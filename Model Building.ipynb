      "\n",
      "allie hamilton, rachel mcadams, is a wealthy young woman living in 1940s south carolina who falls deeply in love with the poor but charming noah calhoun, ryan gosling, over the summer. the two part when allie's judgmental mother anne, joan allen, bars noah from seeing allie and his attempts to contact her during the war are blocked by her. allie meets the equally wealthy lon hammond jr., james marsden, but she doesn't feel as strongly about him as noah and when the two reunite she finds herself falling back in love with him despite the obstacles they face. we also witness an elderly man, james garner, reading their story to a woman who has dementia, gena rowlands, i'd be surprised if you couldn't figure out who they were by the end of the film.\n",
      "\n",
      "all of the clichã (c)s are present in this film as we have the romeo and juliet formula, the love triangle and the elderly versions of the characters reminiscing but this film does them so well. allen is great as the emotionally wounded mother who expects her daughter to face the same fate as she has and reject true love in the place of a wealthy, reliable who she doesn't truly love. marsden is charming as hammond jr. and he does seem achingly sincere as he lets allie walk off into the sunset and having gena rowlands tearfully recognize her husband is manipulative but if you have talent like that it would be a crime not to use it. you have to accept immediately that the world the film lives in will allow noah and allie to end up together no matter what and if you are capable of suspending your disbelief you can really enjoy this hunk of cheese.\n",
      "\n",
      "the likability of the lead actress also can't be counted out as mcadams makes a character who could easily seem annoying with her lack of backbone throughout the first half of the film. the most common problem that romantic films have is that the leading lady or character is either extremely bland or intensely dislikable but the notebook avoids this by making allie charming and intelligent even while she struggles to stand up for what she really wants. mcadams looks like she's in a jo-ann fabric and craft stores ad throughout the whole film as her face glows, her dimples pop and she wears an endless array of stylish 1950s dresses but more than just her look mcadams has that \"it factor\" that makes her endlessly endearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "the cinematography is also gorgeous as the carolina region of the united states, seen in every nicholas sparks adaptation, looks like a postcard. when the two go out on a rowboat and encounter some doves while dappled light hits mcadams just right it's every girls dream. the sex scene should also reveal special mention as the famous argument in the rain that precedes it builds up the sexual tension and when they get down to it we see nice little details like allie's pearls getting in the way. it's not up there with don't look now (1973) as an artistic achievement but it's pretty damn sexy for a pg-13 film.\n",

      "The expand match is <function expand_contractions.<locals>.expand_match at 0x0000000010280510> and text is the notebook is a romantic movie about two lovers, noah and allie, who spend a delightful summer together in south carolina. the couple falls quickly in love only to run into a few conflicts down the road. allie is from a very wealthy family and noah is a mill worker who comes from a very poor family. due to this circumstance, the realities of the time prevented the two from seeing each other. this part of the movie shows the conflicts of social classes among relationships in the 1940's. despite their differences, noah continues to fight for allie with every ounce of love in his body. once allie moves off to college, leaving noah behind, noah writes letters to her every single day for a year. i personally love this part of the movie because it shows the true connection and commitment noah had to allie. in the movie noah says, \"i wrote you 365 letters. i wrote you every day for a year. it wasn't overï¿ 1/2 it still isn't over.\" this movie truly emphasizes the meaning of love in the way that noah dedicates himself to to the girl he loves. as time passes on, noah and allie try to move on from one another. noah joins the war and allie meets a new young man. allie surprisingly falls in love with the man she met and quickly gets engaged. the new young man is rich and wealthy and everything her parents could imagine for her however it wasn't enough. it almost seemed like allie forgot about noah completely until one day when she saw an add for noah and his new house in the paper. at that very moment all of allie's feelings came rushing back to her. although noah and allies relationship was complicated by all means, allie decides to go see noah to check in on him. during the weekend noah and allie have lots of fun as well as arguments. during one of their fights noah says, \"its not gonna be easy. its going to be really hard; we're gonna have to work at this everyday, but i want to do that because i want you.\" i love this quote because of the reality it brings to real life. relationships can often be complicated and life can often be hard but it is something that you have to work with to get to where you want to be. one of my favorite quotes from the movie is when noah gives allie advice, \"you cant live your life for other people. you've got to do what's right for you, even if it hurts some people you love.\" this is my favorite quote because it is something that i often need to remind myself as well. noah is telling allie to do whats best for her and to think about herself for once instead of letting the worlds expectations get in the way. once allie and noahs weekend comes to an end, allie is left with a difficult decision regarding noah and her fiancï¿ 1/2 (c). she is left to choose between two men who both mean the world to her. i recommend this movie to everyone because i believe it shows the true definition of love between two people. the notebook has lots of conflict and challenge within it but no matter what noah keeps trying to push through and move forward with his life. i believe this movie is one of the best romantic dramas out there and hope other people enjoy it as much as i did.\n",

      "the notebook, directed by nick cassavetes, is the story of a young couple who fall in love but face many challenges that work against their union.   it is a tale of passionate love told in a classical way. \n",
      "except love, the power is portrayed in the movie. anne hamilton, the mother of allie, married john hamilton who is allie's father. she leads allie to see his ex-boyfriend who is working in the farm and do not have money, power and social position. she told allie that she wants to elope with him when she was young but this action was omitted by the policeman. she does not feel regret because she loves john and he has power and money. she wants to let allie know if she elopes with her ex-boyfriend successfully, she will have nothing. in her position, the power is more important than love because power can bring a stable life for her. her behaviour let many couples to think power and love, which one be more important? \n",
      "this type of love story is a classic because it is used in many different films and novels. most romantic stories have a common plot where the protagonist finds love in someone but something happens which makes them unable to be together. then the love-stricken character struggles to keep love aflame despite a lot of difficulties. in the end, the couple manages to stay together. when this formula for romance is used in a film, the audience can feel a little bored.  however, the notebook manages to maintain the hearts and minds of the viewer for the entire two and a half hours.  this is because of the amazing and passionate on-screen chemistry of allie played by rachel mcadams.\n",
      "another element that sets this story apart from other classic love tales, is the way the director organizes the sequence of events. flashbacks between the past and the present are weaved seamlessly throughout. in the film, an old man is reading a story to an old woman, which makes people feel the old man is the narrator who just tells the story and leads the plot development. the old woman gets senile dementia, which makes her to live in the old people's home. noah is the protagonist in the story and allie is the person who is loved by noah. they have a lovely story. \n",
      "the main actors ryan gosling and rachael mcadams (young noah and young allie), coincidentally, were born in the same city of london, ontario in canada. ryan's rugged good looks, and charming demeanor will make every woman swoon. rachael mcadam's eyes like thousands of constellations bestrew the sky that spark the glamour and curly long hair are able to make a stamp in every man's heart. after the movie released, the on screen couple took their love across the movie into reality. during mid-2005 to mid-2007, rachael mcdams dated ryan gosling. in mid-2008, they briefly reunited. so people will find how satisfying of this movie that shows the love from young to old and from fiction to non-fiction. \n",
      "the setting successful combines a quiet and boisterous atomosphere. quiet illustrates the love in the peaceful environment. boisterous shows the love still survived after the suffering. if you can imagine, the peaceful environment is that couples are paddling the boat on the lake, which draw a beautiful picture for the audience. perfect combination will make audience feel the grateful of love. it is a warm and sweet picture for the audience. in here, two people are reuniting together although they leave with each other seven years. on the boat, two people are enjoying the love and reminding them past experiences, which they include happiness and sadness stories that they suffered.\n",
      "nick uses the notebook reflects united states of america history during the 1940s. in that time, the world war ii happened that lead many man joined the war. as we know, the capitalism was developed very fast in that time, which would cause the social division increased. the lower classes such as labour and farmer did not have enough money that cause them have onerous works but get lower paid. nick reflects these situations successfully.\n",
      "one thing that i really admired is the composure that the characters show when they must see their love in the arms of another. it is better to set your love free rather than enforce a love that does not belong to you. unwilling love will never bring happiness.\n",

      "\n",
      "the term, \"love\", is a very plain and simple four letter word but yet it can be the unelaborated sensation of either the mind, body, soul or perhaps all of them at once. so it has never been how much the others can provide you but how much are you willing to sacrifice to contribute to others. with that part understood and done well, that would be \"love\" in its purest form, untouched and uncontaminated.\n",
      "\n",
      "i do believe that love comes from the heart and its intention would be the most sanctified of all other thoughts. however, if we process the original love with our brain, it tells us otherwise. our brain is a calculative, cold and unhallowed central processing unit that we have. it informs us with what's best and what's the most feasible for our plan. sometimes, it deceives us and transforms us into a wicked, inconsiderate and detached person that we seek to avoid. simply put, \"what's pure from the heart is turned impure by our brain.\" do we just let it be or do we struggle to find a balance between both of them?\n",

      "to be honest, i've sat there throughout the 120 minutes runtime trying very hard to get myself to maybe like the film but i ultimately failed. it's just not possible for me do it. my mind told me that there was neither a cause nor motivation in it that can move my rigid yet fragile heart. \n",
      "\n",
      "nonetheless, ryan gosling and rachel mcadams surely have given their best in the film. the setting is pretty perfect for such love story and some of the scenes are quite well done, especially the one with both noah and allie taking a ride on a boat out on the river. i love that scene as it's beautiful. the colour tone is right, the depth of field is very well done and the characters' emotion is candid. although i didn't manage to hear the whole soundtrack that is in the film due to quite a lot of reasons but i guess the background music and sound effect should have set the right tempo and feel for most scenes.\n",

      "The expand match is <function expand_contractions.<locals>.expand_match at 0x0000000010280510> and text is by 2004, they had, like, twelve adaptations of nicholas sparks books, and it took them this long to get around to adapting his first one. hey, whatever, i welcome it, because this film is actually pretty good, and we seriously need compensation for \"a walk to remember\", not just between 2002 and 2004, but still to this day, yet that didn't stop the critics from having some kind of bias that kept them from liking this. hey, i can't say that i went into this film thinking, \"from the director of 'john q' comes an adaptation of a book by the author of 'a walk to remember' that i'm sure will not stink\", nor did i walk away finding it awesome, but make no mistake, this film is better than they say, even though it does have its cheesy moments. hey, when this film came out, ryan gosling had just got done playing a neo-nazi and some teenager who brutally murdered people... in two separate films, so it was about time for him to do something a bit fluffier, much like rachel mcadams, who just had to have been an emotional wreck after getting off of such intense projects as \"the hot chick\" and \"mean girls\". i can think of some people who would say that they were more disturbed by \"the hot chick\" than anything that gosling did before this film, so i guess the match works, yet gosling still didn't immediately find his handsome, charismatic and talented self fired into the stardom that mcadams got by this film, probably because gosling still had the integrity and, well, after this film, money to go back to doing stuff that middle-aged housewives aren't likely to even hear about. i mean, don't get me wrong, gosling broke out eventually, but come on, it still took a while even after this film, though that might just be because of the mixed reviews, because, as you all know very well, the members of the pop culture who decide who becomes popular or not always listen to critics. sarcasm aside, the audience is right in saying that nick sparks actually did something good before doing about 100 mediocre things, though you shouldn't completely disregard the critics, as their complaints are hardly completely invalid.\n",
      "\n",
      "at just over two hours, the film is somewhat lengthy, and is certainly pretty meaty, yet its concept, in a lot of areas, holds too much meat to fully juice in two hours, as reflected by story structure's pacing's being, like the pacing of plenty of other nicholas sparks novel adaptations, uneven, having enough meditative points to compel thoroughly, but still taking advantage of its main story's being framed to all too often only hit highlights in exposition in a storybook, objective fashion that distances you from substance a bit, and thins out meditative value. the film will run a steady pace, only to suddenly jar things along, and while you're never quite jarred loose from the film, events are often awkwardly tossed at you, and such a formula proves to be detrimental to the momentum of substance's impact, whose blows are further softened by yet another hallmark in nick sparks stories: subtlety issues. there have been more histrionic interpretations of sparks' questionable dramatic efforts, but when this film's genuineness slips, its subtlety lapses range from offputting to considerable, whether when it's slapping down a rather disconcertingly syrupy dramatic beat or going so far as to craft such borderline over-the-top characters as wealthy, disapproving parents antagonists, whose layers feel a particularly forced, yet are not the only questionable components to characterization depth. our leads are at least well-portrayed enough to come off as layered and meaty, but when it's all said and done, there is only so much depth in this film, and i don't know if it's because of the superficiality in sparks' story concept or because something got lost in translation when sparks' story was brought to the screen, but either way, the point is that histrionics can be fought back only so much. needless to say, the histrionics would be more forgivable if the storytelling beats that are somewhat cheesed up weren't so familiar, because if no other department in this effort feels somewhat lazy, it's the originality department, which turns over stone after stone, until predictability ensues. there's a twist to this film that is so easy to see coming that, before too long, the film even feels like it gives up trying to obscure it, and while that is the height in the final product's predictability, it's not the only predictable beat to the final product, which makes up for originality and dramatic shortcomings more often than not with considerable inspiration, but faces shortcomings nevertheless, falling short of its full potential. with that said, the final product doesn't quite fall so far from grace that it doesn't reward, having many a flaw, but ultimately quite a few more strengths, even in the photographic department.\n",
      "\n",
      "the film isn't stunning, or at least not consistently so, yet when cinematographer robert fraisse's eye catches the right environment, the visual results range from striking or truly gorgeous, boasting a soulful grace that catches your eyes when it is infused in fraisse's photography, as surely as it grips your attention when it is infused in aaron zigman's score, which is a bit formulaic and minimalist, but lovely and heartfelt, with a distinguished flavor that proves to be comfortably compatible with the substance that it compliments so well. aesthetically, the film accels with a graceful taste that does a fine job of breathing soul into flawed substance, whose effectiveness is ameliorated a bit by the filmmakers' aesthetic punch-ups, but, quite frankly, doesn't need pretty visuals and nice tunes to gain your attention. nicholas sparks' story concept is, of course, flawed, being derivative and with its share of subtlety issues, but when you step back and see through all of the hiccups, you can find one of sparks' most worthy concepts, and while such a concept is not fleshed out nearly as much as it could have been in execution, it's rich with endearing heart that cannot be ignored, especially when emphasized by what is, in fact, done right in jeremy leven's and jan sardi's script, and, of course, nick cassavetes' direction. even outside of this film, cassavetes isn't exactly notorious for his genuineness as a teller of a conceptually resonant tale, and sure enough, the histrionic value in the film is all too often milked for all its worth, yet for every somewhat overblown dramatic beat, cassavetes delivers a resonant punch that gives you a taste of what could have been, and firmly reminds you of what ultimately is, a very compelling drama that, in spite of its shortcomings, wins you over time and again. by the time we reach the final act, the film really starts to pierce with sentimentality that is backed enough by genuineness and soul to all but move you to tears, and while this story concept deserves to have more of that punch, perhaps even at a greater intensity, golden occasions can be found the in midst of a compellingness that, while often diluted, never dissipates, being backed by much in the way of inspiration, both off of the screen and on the screen. the acting isn't killer, but it is strong across the board, with james garner and gena rowlands ultimately delivering on sparkling chemistry and emotional range in their portrayal of good, but old and deteriorating souls, while the dashing ryan gosling and gorgeous rachel mcadams carry most of the film with their distinguished charismas, bonded through powerful chemistry, and backed with a human emotional resonance that is more layered than the actual written characterization of the noah calhoun and allison \"allie\" hamilton characters, who are well-defined enough by their portrayers to engross as worthy leads. many are not likely to walk away loving this film, but it is rather underappreciated, being flawed something fierce, but ultimately with enough inspiration and rich soul to thoroughly engage and ultimately reward.\n",
      "\n",
      "overall, pacing unevenness keeps the film from soaking up its full depth, whose kick goes further diluted by subtlety issues and conventionalism, until you're left with a flawed final product, but one that still compels, using lovely cinematography and score work to compliment the taste within nicholas sparks' undeniably meaty story concept, which is brought to life well enough by nick cassevetes' direction and a strong cast for \"the notebook\" to ultimately stand as a flawed, but quite good melodrama that rewards the patient.\n",

      "The expand match is <function expand_contractions.<locals>.expand_match at 0x000000001985FD08> and text is as a huge lion king fan my opinion on the film may be slightly bias, but i feel like it is a great movie. they did not change much and with new technology, disney and jon favreau were able to beautifully recreate pride rock and entire african savannah. probably the only thing i did not like about this (and other previous live action disney remakes) is the fact that the characters just seem to be mimicking the exact same lines as the original verses making them their own. with the exception of chiwetel ejiofor who does a phenomenal job as scar in my personal opinion. overall, the lion king is a great movie and if you love the original as much as i do you definitely will be satisfied, or not because i know some of you guys are die hard purist 😂.\n",

      "The expand match is <function expand_contractions.<locals>.expand_match at 0x000000001985FD08> and text is the original animated film holds a special place in my heart and mind but i thoroughly enjoyed what director jon favreau and co. have delivered. despite being nearly a shot-for-shot remake (in terms of plot) with some special changes here and there, i felt the same bit of joy, sadness, suspense and happiness all over again maybe even more so with it being \"live-action.\" i do wish there was more distinction in appearance between some characters of the same species like the hyenas and female lions. for instance, i could not tell nala and sarabi apart in scenes they share unless they were not speaking. however, with movie being a photorealistic reimagining of the animation, the identical-ness makes sense given the same would apply for the real wildlife. as for the films soundtrack, the voice cast, which consists of global recording artists, deliver worthy new renditions of the classic songs from the original film. even beyonces original song \"spirit\" fits perfectly with the story and the moment in which it is used. also like the original, this film certainly has a high rewatch value as i just cannot wait... to see it again.\n",
