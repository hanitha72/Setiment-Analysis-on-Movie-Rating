ReviewID,review
92876,Was good. Nothing like the original but I believe that was the point.
92877,I absolutely loved it! A wonderful rendition of the original. Just dont compare to the cartoon version. Let this movie be its own and you will like it
92878,"I love the movie! Good job director! 
I appreciate all the work some great people have put in for years. "
92879,"GREAT MOVIE!!  Same as the original, but the cinematography made a huge difference!!"
92880,Realistic.   Fantastic special effects
92881,Almost exactly like the original
92882,"Visually stunning, beautiful film"
92883,Did not care for Beyonce as the voice of Nala. There was no emotion or anything. You can tell she just read it straight off the script! So disappointing
92884,Thought it was a good movie overall i enjoyed it
92885,We loved every second of the Lion King. I even believe this is the best 3D movie that has ever been made. The special effects were amazing! And Fandango is the only way to go!
92886,"Better version, some darker moments in comparison with the original, but is a must see."
92887,Wonderful CGI and stayed pretty true to the original with a few clever additions however the music could have used a lot more umph and the characters needed some expression on their faces
92888,I love it. Love that it stuck to the heart of the story while also telling in a bit of a new and slightly different way to give it a freshness to the story we all love. It was awesome!!!
92889,The movie was true to the original Lion King.  I loved it! I would definitely go see it again.
92890,I really enjoyed the  3D effects. It made you feel as though you were rite there. The voiceovers were great as whell. I may go see it again
92891,Excellent movie. Funny!
92892,"We liked the new versions of the Lion King, it showed a lot of the animals of the wild life. They sung the good songs of the animation version. Like ""I just can't wait to be King"". My grandkids want to see it again."
92893,It Was Serious And Funny At The Same Time..Awesome Movie
92894,"I liked how it stayed true to the original movie. I liked the original better, but this one was enjoyable!"
92895,let me start with I loved the movie. it was an enhancement off the original and love the new things thrown in. my only critique is that I felt beyonce was a bad choice for Nalas voice. she oversang some parts in the songs and added an exclamation point to every sentence she spoke. honestly she took away from the movie. otherwise this is a must watch!
92896,The movie was decent.. Better than expected but the cartoon will always be my favorite.
92897,Left some parts out. Rafiki hitting him on the head with his stick. But it was still really good. Animation was amazing
92898,Absolutely amazing. Just like the original. Voice acting was amazing. Especially Beyonc. She was amazing!!
92899,"I like that they tried to stay to the original as much as possible with lines and that they added scenes to explain things more. I just feel like this movie was setup with high expectations but it didn't meet them. The original is the best, this was ok."
92900,This is not the Lion King. This is exactly what Josh Pray said. So sad
92901,"The graphics/animation were so good that you couldn't even tell they weren't real animals until they opened their mouths!
Stayed true to the original story.  A must see."
92902,It could of been better.
92903,Parts were left out . It was good but I prefer the original
92904,"It was ok, but fell way short of expectations. Key lines were either missed or changed and took away the full impact that those scenes had on the story. The animated real life animals lacked originality and individual character and emotion. Overall it's an entertaining couple hours if you're a Lion King fan, but had the potential to be so much more. "
92905,The best movie of 2019
92906,"The unrestricted casting for Zazu, Timon, & Pumbaa was great- nearly every other character casting was restricted and flawed. Other than that a great movie! Saw 3 times!"
92907,Best damn adaptation
92908,"Loved the Lion King, was worried that it would be changed from the original but it was not. Very enjoyable cant wait to see it again!"
92909,"Movie was absolutely amazing, and really stayed true to the original. Just like many other movie goers, Timon and Pumba really kept my funny bone tickled. Loved it!"
92910,"Felt Scar wasnt evil enough. Loved Timon and Pumbaa!! Great version, but the animation will always be my favorite."
92911,"I loved the cinematics and real lion sounds, but the first movie songs were better. Beyonce's overall delivery of Nala was poor singing wise and acting."
92912,I loved that they did not change the original story much. Amazing animation.
92913,"great movie and theater,5 stars"
92914,The computer animation was fabulous!
92915,Beautifully made and animated.
92916,I enjoyed the movie. Very happy they didn‚Äôt do much to change it from the original. Just some new banter between a few characters which was pretty entertaining.
92917,It was so AWESOME!  The real animals were so gorgeous & felt like they were ready to trample you!!  The 3D puts you in the movie & I swear a flying bug or tiny bird or God knows what flew over my right shoulder!!  AMAZING & the singers were so terrific!!  Absolutely loved the movie!!!  Heard a couple people complain it was too loud but I loved it & I‚Äôm 67 yrs old!!  Thank you!!
92918,"It was a good movie, but stayed extremely close to the script of the first one.   "
92919,It was a great movie . We all enjoyed it as a family.
92920,Just as good as the original . Loved it .
92921,I enjoyed the entire movie. My wife and her mom also loved the movie!!!
92922,"Pretty, but boring. The original is much better."
92923,baby simba is the cutest thing ever
92924,I really like the movie
92925,Cashgrab for sure. No emotion behind the voices. No facial expressions. Original songs sound... off.
92926,"Awesome job. Great work capturing the feeling of the original.  The graphics were awesome and realistic. Captured the drama from the animated film and it showed in the characters faces. Not sure why others are saying no expression when I feel they captured an actual animals expression. All the voice actors did an awesome job.  The ""critics"" need to go back to watching indie films because this movie was great. 
   "
92927,Maybe a little too life like for my taste. Still a classic non the less.
92928,It was an amazing movie
92929,Good just not as good as the cartoon. I felt that some personality was lost.
92930,I loved every single part of this movie from the beginning to the end
92931,"Iloved it , it was the same exact movie thank god they didn‚Äôt change anything!!"
92932,"It was more real than I expected. It was also very close to the original, which was great!"
92933,"Exactly like the cartoon I saw 25 years ago that my oldest children made me watch 3687 times.
Amazing CGI."
92934,"like that the story was not changed, pretty much scene for scene match with a few difference. the film is absolutely stunning. I saw it in Imax"
92935,Absolutely loved it !
92936,Visually so amazing and stayed true to the movie in the best way. Very much enjoyed it!
92937,Beyonc√©‚Äôs voice just kind of ruined the authenticity of the film. So many of my favorite parts were removed
92938,It  starts off slow but gets better about half an hour into the movie and also more action and funny  parts
92939,"Super comfortable, great experience !"
92940,Awesome story line...with life like animals.  Music was phenomenal...characters were ah-mazing!  I loved hearing Nala's voice!
92941,Enjoyed the movie I will be buying it once available.
92942,The live action was amazing and the movie stayed true to the original. Overall I loved it!!!
92943,Loved the realist animals
92944,Didn‚Äôt like the fake crying from simba when mufasa died. Needed to be more powerful
92945,I loved the story content. I also loved seeing how real the animals looked and behaved. Lion King was an absolutely amazing movie.
92946,Stayed true to the original story for the most part.
92947,Great take on the original! My family loves it!
92948,Loved the movie. Looks so real and well done.
92949,"The graphics were really beautiful. The new original music was outstanding. Of course the Elton John, Circle of Life is always beautiful."
92950,"love it, it s amazing,  hilarious"
92951,Incredible. No idea what the critics are talking about. 
92952,I dislike Beyonc being nala her voice didnt go good with that character
92953,"They took out some of most iconic parts of the original and changed the tone of some of the lines they left. I love Bey, but I couldve done without the added lines for adult Nala and the song Spirit. Graphics were good. I did love the modern humor though. Wasnt happy with the changes to Rafikis character either. It was good, but I prefer the original. Maybe Ive seen it too many times. Oh well."
92954,"I should have waited to watch this on Netflix instead of paying to see it. This wasn‚Äôt worth it in my opinion, save your money!"
92955,"Word for word, frame by frame, a lot less emotion. Dozed off, bored and really couldn't wit for it to end so I could come home and watch the cartoon. "
92956,This was a very well pur together! loved the beautiful scenes that made you feel like you were in Africa. All the characters were true to the 1994 version but Scare. I felt he was a little dry in this one. I was looking for my favorite parts to appear and was discovered when the 3 hyenas didn't do the Mufasa makes me shiver partüòÇüòÇ Put still enjoyed it very much
92957,Loved the original and loved the remake as well! Stunning and beautiful story!!!ü¶Åüëçüèª
92958,Simba is a rip off of Kimba. Disney doesn‚Äôt have an original thought or idea in their collective heads.
92959,"I enjoyed the movie, took my grandson who is 7, he got a little restless at parts.  My sister also went with us, her comments the movie was a little dark for
Little people."
92960,"Amazing CGI; beautifully re-told. Once again, Rotten Tomatoes critics think they're too cool to enjoy a good movie!"
92961,"Beautifully captures the spirit of the original, I loved it! "
92962,Perfect remake of a childhood favorite
92963,Wonderful movie. Don't  think children younger than 8 should see movie. Some very scary parts.ie. lions fighting and hyenas.
92964,Absolutely amazing. Must see for all ages. 
92965,I loved the loyalty of the movie to the cartoon version. It was a great experience to watch the movie and remember de first time when I was in front of the TV and they play it. But I also missed some part of the cartoon version that was not showed on this movie.
92966,Felt it was overall underwhelming when you compare it to the original.
92967,I absolutely loved EVERYTHING- it was so real and intense
92968,Love Disney movies.  Still got emotional same as cartoon. Loved it.
92969,"Loved it  
I would go watch it all over again"
92970,"Definitely worth seeing but it doesn't really measure up to the original. It was just missing the magic of the original. Some parts were expanded or slightly more explained while others were shortened. ""Be prepared"" was far too short for my taste and as much as I LOVE Beyonce I could do without so many runs in ""Can you feel the love tonight"". Voice acting is amazing across the entire cast but with the realistic approach it is hard to actually SEE the emotion or weight behind the spoken word. 

Go see the movie, make your own opinion."
92971,A lot of the comedy from the original was missed!
92972,The animated version is better.
92973,"The movie was great, but the theater was hot."
92974,The Lion King was excellent. I was a kid all over again.
92975,"The animals were so realistic, it was remarkable.  Loved the way the story unfolded, but was a bit violent for young children."
92976,Amazing special effects!!  Great movie!
92977,"It needed more intense, it was too subtle. Even the original had better intense in the sound"
92978,"Visually stunning, hits all the beats of the original plus more. "
92979,Loved Beyonce and the upgrades
92980,"Great visuals, but mediocre voiceovers. Scar was more tedious and dull then evil. Original version had much better vocals & chemistry."
92981,Amazing!  Graphics were incredible!
92982,Excellent Movie!!! I Love the Lion King movies!
92983,"A second animated to live-action semi-success from Jon Favreau! Its strengths lie within the stunning visuals and stellar voice cast! Overall, this movie leans towards introducing The Lion King to a newer crowd while still faintly acknowledging those who enjoyed the animated classic, which can be a good thing! "
92984,My girlfriend and I loved the movie and we are hoping to come back. We laughed and be sad at few shoots but it was perfect.
92985,GREAT movie for all family members.
92986,Utterly amazing.  Loved it!!!
92987,Thank you to whomever. My family and I enjoyed watching Lion King. The graphics the music friend the movie and I just want to say thank you
92988,"The CGI was awesome, but the music was NOT good!"
92989,It was very realistic. I would watch again.
92990,Great movie seen it in 4Dx... Loved every minute of it. I promise you wont be dissatisfied at all. They Nailed It to the T!! üòÅ
92991,Best Disney remake by far!!
92992,"The Lion King 2019 was surprisingly well made. I was prepared to dislike it, but came away very impressed and satisfied. It was a retelling, yet consistent with the original story. I saw the IMAX 3D version and found it visually stunning. The original Scar and hyenas were better, but so glad James Earl Jones was able to reprise his role. No one else would do!"
92993,Great movie ! It was like the original which I love! My 4 year old enjoyed it and so did my husband and I. . The voices were great! Especially Mufasa he‚Äôs was deep like the original. . Had funny scenes as well ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
92994,I absolutely love the  rendition of this movie. The only thing I disliked was the song by Beyonc
92995,Couldnt outdo the original.
92996,It changed a few things and I thought it was pretty  good.
92997,I liked it when Simba  became king
92998,Liked how well the animals were real. Exact same script from the original. Disliked that it requires a more mature audience than the animation to truly enjoy.
92999,"They were successful in remaking The Lion King - if EVERYTHING that Made the original great was taken out! Everything was wrong. I feel like you could hear the actors saying ""well, just pay me and I will read the line"". There was no heart or dedication from any of the actors. They could have done SO MUCH, and yet FAILED SO MUCH!"
93000,"The animation is spectacular.  This movie is funnier and a bit less emotional than the first version.  Our group, ages 9 to 75, really enjoyed it."
93001,"Visually stunning, but repetitive in its demonstration thereof. The voice actors pale in comparison to the original and the self-referential ""winks"" to the audience are forced. Still, there are moments of power."
93002,It was as I remembered
93003,"We all know the story.  The CGI was award winning (remember you heard it here first!)!  Couldnt stop thinking about the experience‚Äîthis was more than a movie!
Dont misss it‚Äîin IMAX 3D if possible!"
93004,Disliked scars singing part! Couldve been longer!
93005,The cinematography was fantastic and beautiful and it does not disappoint just as good as the original dare I say even better
93006,Awesome movie for all ages
93007,Very well done. Loved every second of it.
93008,Not close to perfection as the original but it turned out to be a great movie
93009,"Scars Be prepared was better in the cartoon version.
Timon and Pumba were the same if not better in the 2019 version. Lots of extra humor,fresh jokes and clever Diolague for the family and also individual that may be missed or caught if you are paying close enough attention. Can you feel the love sang by Donald Glover and Beyonc was unfortunately average not great. But the over animation and action scenes were top notch and done really well. The weakest part of this 2019 version would have to be the movie sequencing and transitions/story telling over all feels more put together in the original cartoon version and better all around. But over all the 2019 version is fresh and well worth seeing by your self or with friends/family."
93010,It was wonderful I really enjoyed it with my family
93011,Children were entertained.
93012,"I wish my movies experience was better, movie was blurry, volume was low and the theater 3 was even warm at points. To too it off I bought my tickets in here not to make a line and I still had to make a line to get actual paper tickets to enter, so why get charged a convenience fee? Bc it wasnt convenient at all"
93013,Great remake of one of the most iconic classic movies done by Disney.  Loved how it followed the story line.
93014,"Just like the original, but worse. It feels soulless and the voice acting is weak, especially by comparison to what came before. The effects are amazing (and probably will be for the next two years), but the 'photo realism' means that there is zero emotion to be found in the visuals - it's all in the amazing soundtrack. Honestly, I'd rather watch this movie with the dialogue cut out, like a dramatised David Attenborough documentary.  "
93015,Great movie! Loved the reality of the movie.
93016,Watched both ways now and its definitely worth watching in 3D at least once.
93017,Of course can't beat the original.. But was very good.. I liked it
93018,It was really a good movie.
93019,Awesome like the cartoon. Loved it
93020,"I read some the people that had poor reviews 
Seriously did u c it 3D... then u really missed the movie. 
Holy Moses! Do urself a favor take it all the movie has to offer.  The child inside must b forever gone, so sad ! 
It was Spectacular!  If it didnt stir u emotionally when he roared at the top of Pride Rock at the end, check ur pulse u may b dead inside."
93021,It was a beautiful retelling of the Lion King...made more powerful by the incredible artistry and animation of the realistic animals and the land they inhabit..
93022,"Disney did a great job changing from animation to real animals! The added scenes were great. Overall great movie. The first lion king was my favorite Disney movie when I was a kid, love the remake."
93023,"Though the cinematography was amazing. The movie did not at all feel like the first one. And I know it never will, the music felt flat and forced though out the movie. The character build was good but not great, and the some actors felt a bit out of place. For example Beyonc, if she played the mother instead of Nayla I feel like her voice would fit that character much more. As it is demanding and sa very strong female voice, And maybe have a African American teen play Nayla. One of my favorite characters in the movie though was scar. His character felt so real and relatable. And very scary. Undeniably this movie was filled with laughter and comedy. And brought joy to everyone in the audience at the perfect times. And Though  the overall back round of why scar wanted the throne was pretty cheesy, it was enough. None the less this was a GOOD movie not as good I wanted but good."
93024,"Cinematography amazing, but no emotional connection to this movie. They should've brought back the original voices, as well. The new ones just didn't match. And what about that drawn out scene with Simba's tuft of fur...a pointless filler. Pull out the original and save your money. Wait for the video. Disappointed."
93025,I loved that they used many of the same lines from the first Lion King and also that they added more fun parts. I also really loved that they included the same songs.
93026,"i loved the movie , i seen the original and this was well done"
93027,Very enjoyable and loved watching it with my grand daughters!
93028,Awesome remake...looks like you're there...the new 4D is bonkers!!!
93029,"The iconic song ‚Äòbe prepared ‚Äò felt like it was cut n dry, which is kind of a downer considering what an iconic song it was in the original . The audio also seemed a bit off in quality . But the movie  was really good , thoroughly enjoyed it !"
93030,"I thought the movie was ok. The nostalgia was there, but in my opinion Seth Rogen made the movie. If it wasnt for him the movie would have been probably 2 stars. Not taking anything away from James Earl Jones since he was my second favorite actor in this movie."
93031,"This a a scene-for-scene remake of the cartoon so the viewer can't help but compare it to the original. And in doing so, this movie fails miserably. A big part of the cartoon were the facial expressions that went along with the dialogue. The 2019 film is so focused on realism that the dialogue and facial expressions are completely disconnected. Also, the songs in the 2019 version are a pathetic imitation of classic Disney songs. 

I did something I have never done in my life. I walked out of this movie. Watching what Disney was doing to my favorite childhood movie was depressing and infuriating. 

Do not watch this abomination. Just rewatch the original. "
93032,"The story was good but not deep enough to tug on the heartstrings of viewers. It is most definitely not for children, much too frightening and scary."
93033,"Movie was good but not great. Too many slow scenes, kids lost interest. Nallas voice needed to be stronger in depth and volume. The pixel creation was amazing!!!"
93034,The film may not compare to it's original source material but the great vocal performances and visually stunning effects make it an enjoyable experience.
93035,Not enough emotion. Beyonc√© did not match up well to Nala. It was just meh. 
93036,It‚Äôs was fine. It‚Äôs the same as the original (cartoon) version just a few changes with music.
93037,"Loved it! My all time favorite. A gotta see, can believe made with computer pixels."
93038,"The small changes to the script is what I disliked the most.  ""You're Mufasa's Boy!!!"" to a subtle ""Your the son of Mufasa."" The passion wasn't there."
93039,Awesome remake!!! My daughter (14 years old) and I loved it!!!
93040,"It‚Äôs really amazing what they can achieve with technology these days. The visual effects are truly amazing and realistic‚ÄîThis movie looks like a National Geographic program set to music. However the art of the original is incomparable‚Äîthe beautiful color of the scenery and the emotion of the characters is sacrificed in this new medium. I still cry every time I watch the original, but it was not so during this remake. I will say the songs were well done (with the exception of Be Prepared). And the voice cast did well with what they were given (especially Timon and Pumba). However while enjoyable, the original remains FAR superior. The remake was unnecessary in my opinion, but if anything I hope it will introduce this story to a new generation of kids who will grow up loving the Lion King as I did. ‚ÄîA 90s Kid"
93041,It was so real! Excellent movie!
93042,Beautiful CGI.  Unlike anything else Ive seen.
93043,Thought the movie was very well done
93044,Hermosa pelicula. Tremendo nivel de detalle.
93045,Our family loved it!!  Some of our favorite parts from the original weren‚Äôt in this one... but there were enough new and funny parts that we still loved the new version too :)
93046,This movie was awesome.  Everyone around me enjoyed all the characters.  So glad James Earl jones came back.  I was worried because its a perfect movie and my favorite movie of all time. it was slightly different.  I missed the hyenas contributing to be prepared.  The real animals was a little different in the beginning.  The punchlines from the hyenas were not as funny but they were more freightening and that was pretty neat to watch.  But all in all it was still great.
93047,"It was great for a date movie, I love it . So close to the 1st movie .."
93048,"SAW THE 3D VERSION. IT WAS MAGNIFICENT, AMAZING, SPECTACULAR, BREATHTAKING, THE ABSOLUTE BEST DISNEY MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. I saw the animated version and it was great! But this one OH WOW!!!"
93049,It followed the original so well. I loved it!
93050,Loved the new real life animal animation.
93051,Was super awesome! I missed some of the stuff from the 1994 movie like the Hawaiian thing that tomon and puma did and how the animals were all stacked up together but obviously it wouldnt be a live action movie if those things were in there. I think my only problem with the whole movie in its entirety was when Beyonc and the others were singing and they put sooo many unnecessary riffs in the songs that it almost seemed like they were just trying to be more extra than they needed to be. Over all it was an amazing movie and Id definitely recommend it.
93052,I liked how it was just like the original movie only more awesome!
93053,"A faithful retelling, while safely conservative compared to recent Disney live action remakes. Satisfying in every way, and blessed that JEJ was able to return as Mufasa."
93054,"This is a beautiful movie.  While it followed closely to the original, I  missed the humor in the 2019 version.  Very creative and good movie but I  think this generation  will miss out."
93055,"Saw this in 3D Imax 4D, best way to watch the Lion King, highly recommend!"
93056,"The animals look very real, but it lack the magic of the cartoon, Jeremy Irons (scar) voice is what makes scar evil. The new scar looks like a homeless person. "
93057,It was good. The same story-line is the same as the first one. The graphic is much better for this one.
93058,"CGI was great, this will be a classic movie forever"
93059,I like that they stuck to the story. Even the of script eggs were jewels
93060,They changed the best parts of the movie. I'm very disappointed.
93061,In certain parts the graphic details looked so real.
93062,If you've seen the original there wasn't much room for them to mess up. I love Beyonce but couldn't stand hearing her voice on screen for some reason .
93063,"Music was amazing 
Every part was perfect between capturing the old movie and adding wonderfully hilarious new details"
93064,It kept the untouchable classic and really brought it to life while adding a slight modern twist to a few of the songs. Left me speechless
93065,loved it! missed Jeremy Irons (and Scar's song) but glad for James Earl Jones. 
93066,"PERFECTION!!! Every aspect of this movie was amazing, and so true to the original. Each animation and CGI animal in this film was spot on. Singing, voice acting, and everything else was incredible. Amazing job, Disney"
93067,This was a childhood favorite of our daughter.  July 20th she turned twenty and this was my birthday present to her.  We loved it!!
93068,exactly the same as the original‚Ä¶ exactly the same
93069,I loved it!!!! Is a must see movie.
93070,Such a magnificent remake!!!! True to the original plus some added humor!
93071,The movie was great  I loved it it's great for all ages  male and female I highly recommend it to everyone thanks for a great movie
93072,Great movie just like the original one. The family enjoyed it.
93073,A good job of keeping the same theme with the animation of the old movie but the remastered songs took away from the overall quality of the film. Make something new! Dont ruin what is already great!
93074,Lion King is a great story with amazing music and visuals. I'm just not sure we needed a CGI version after the original and the beautiful Broadway show.
93075,I thought it was a great movie. This was my 1st time seeing the Lion King story.
93076,Loved The Lion King.  It was very good.  Followed the theme of the original movie.
93077,It was absolutely amazing I loved the entire movie! I have always been a die hard fan for lion king to the point that I have had a tattoo of Hakuna Matata on my foot for years! This movie did not disappoint! I would definitely go back to see it again! And must have it on DVD!
93078,Setting was beautiful. Like sound track too
93079,Have the same heart as the first one it was missing the same heart as the first one
93080,Loved the CG. Story line was great. Very similar.
93081,The animals looked real and I enjoyed watching it with my niece.
93082,The animation was stellar.
93083,Reminded me of my childhood. Amazing remake from Disney.
93084,Just a fantastic movie especially in 3D
93085,Amazing movie so realistic
93086,"Very good, stuck to the original However you dont feel the songs like you did the first one but it was very much enjoyable."
93087,It was exactly like the animated version
93088,This is an awesome movie.
93089,"I loved how it stayed true to the original movie. This was my favorite movie as a child, and I loved seeing it in live action with my daughter."
93090,Just like the animated film but with more detail
93091,I am the worlds most severe movie critic.  This movie is perfect!
93092,"The graphics were done very well, I loved it."
93093,They ruined the best song in the original
93094,The graphics were phenomenal! Everything looks so real. I absolutely loved it!! And would watch it again a million times over!
93095,"The movie is the best ever! Absolutely the BEST! A must-see. The critics, as usual, don‚Äôt know what they are talking about. It‚Äôs the peeps score that really matters!"
93096,"Awful. Love Billy Eichner, but he was so annoying in this movie. And Beyonce was THE WORST. Africa was beautiful, and that's about it."
93097,"very Good, so realistic down to animal interactions."
93098,Sweet movie but just did not grab me me..
93099,The animation was great... Good family film!!
93100,"Loved it all.  But I just didn't feel Beyonce's voice matched Nala's personality.  Other than that, it was beautiful and perfect."
93101,It was excellent and the animation was on point.
93102,The critics got it wrong!  I loved everything about this movie!!!
93103,Wish Disney brought Jeremy Irons back as Scar...
93104,A-maz-ing!!! Definitely a must see for 2019!!
93105,What I loved about this remake was that nothing had changed from the original movie that was made in the 90‚Äôs! Amazing remake!!
93106,I liked the Circle of Life. Many of the cartoon Lion King moments were brought into the movie which was great. Beautifully made.
93107,"May not be as good as the original, but a great spectacle to remind me of why I love Disney and the power of this tale! 
"
93108,Good movie with simple story line and great graphics work. Kids will love this movie
93109,I like that it was real animals instead of animated. The storyline was good used from the animated original version.
93110,"Clever , funny dialogue, great message for life"
93111,Great remake and storyline. The sound was off and not mixed well.
93112,loved the whole experience ‚ù§
93113,"While the movie had some amazing scenes, most of it was style over substance, and you will get more out of the original from 1994."
93114,it is not well acted out and not enough acting. the scenes and singing are messed up. the cartoon is better then this
93115,"don‚Äôt wanna be that guy, but unfortunately the original was better, go watch that for free."
93116,Great visual effects and story line.
93117,Great movie.  Follow the original very well. I think there was three small little changes in the movie that if you want obsessed with the move you may not of found. They did a great job .
93118,Fantastic movie!! Amazing song track!! Way better than the cartoon .
93119,"Don't listen to critics! This movie was wonderful! Great CGI, Timon and Pumbaa funnier than the cartoon. Takes me back to my childhood!"
93120,Overall the live action style doesn't work very well with a movie that has so much emotion. Plus actors like Beyonce just felt out of place. Even though I thought Seth Rogan as Pumba was a great fit.
93121,"I liked how they made the animals seem like they were truly talking & singing, never seen the cartoon one, so that‚Äôs next:))"
93122,Beautiful!!! The movie had great graphics and amazing work!!!!
93123,graphics were great but it just didnt have the same feel. some of the most important scenes of the movie were not as moving as the original.
93124,"Amazing movie, it made me cry from the begging to the end. The animal emotions are there, but they get to you liie animals usually show them: with their eyes and body movements. I was a little scared about the talking and the singing but it's fantastic. I loved everything about it and i just can't wait to go see it again"
93125,It was good but made me want to watch the original more while watching it.
93126,Loved everything!! Cried 3 times!!
93127,"It‚Äôs a shame they couldn‚Äôt stick to the original movie, the plot was the same but they went off course with some things.  Didn‚Äôt care for the music as much, didn‚Äôt think it was as cute (overall) or as funny.  Too much emphasis on Nala...like she was the hero here.  And Beyonc√© knowles....could have done without her üôÑ.  And again, the music was disappointing.  Ehh"
93128,Absolutely breath taking!!!!!!!!!
93129,Always a great story with meaningful lessons but not as good as the original.  The CGI was excellent but the music and casting was off. Would have enjoyed it more had i not already seen the original and the play.
93130,New version of a great movie.  It was fabulous.  Love the music!
93131,"It was absolutely incredible! So true to the original movie, with only three difference from the animation."
93132,I like that it wasn't  animated and I watch it in 3D but I think the story line should of been just like it was the first time. Some scenes where missing which I thought would  of been nice since that how I remember. But overall good movie for the kids to see.
93133,"I‚Äôve read a few reviews saying it was nothing like the original... it‚Äôs like literally a scene for scene remake... it‚Äôs the exact same movie. However, I can see how some people got stuck in the ‚Äúgap‚Äù when fictional characters are too real you fall out of the suspension of disbelief. That being said it was a fantastic remake. I thought it was better than all of the other remakes"
93134,"The new version lost some of the spirit of the original movie. At times answers were revealed too fast. I have watched and adored the 94' version a lot of times and I have memorized every second and every feeling of it, and with the new version I didn't have much of those. Really sad."
93135,A beautiful movie. Very life-like.
93136,"The movie was absolutely beautiful, the graphics were magical, the music was fantastic and the voice actors were phenomenal. Definitely going to see this again.
And yes, The Lion King was so good that I would like to see a remake of Simba's pride."
93137,"Timon and Pumba were more cynical and obnoxious than in the original and were almost unlikable.  Disney keeps trying to push the envelope with their kids movies which I do not appreciate.  As with almost all of these remakes, the original is much better!"
93138,The original was better in my opinion. I actually fell asleep a couple of times.
93139,"Imax works great for this movie, beautiful details takes you close to the nature. Kids and Adults will enjoy alike"
93140,Really good movie so much like the original with a couple of new songs in there
93141,Loved it! The color vision was phenomenal! I love the few twist they added as well!
93142,So disappointing. All the songs are ruined
93143,I did not like the movie!
93144,It was great. Kids loved it.
93145,There's no emotion in the characters at all
93146,The most amazing movie....seen the 1994 version as a cartoon...but this makes it all so perfect!!!  Must see this!!!
93147,Lion King was a wonderful story for the whole family. They stayed true to the original!
93148,They didn't play my favorite Disney song from the movie. But Timon and Pumba more than make up for any little issues.
93149,Great movie excellent plot and action
93150,I absolutely loved it! Beautiful!
93151,LOVED this movie. Very true to the original with some updated comedy.  Definitely seeing this in theaters again!
93152,Great rendition! Life like characters.
93153,Missing iconic stuff but replaced with others..no spoilers...yet scenery and animal super realistic looking sunlight glows off of the Savannah...made me cry all over again I'm still a SIMBA FAN not so much a fan of the person who played adult nala. This was a movie of simba not nala that's my ONLY complaint too much emphasis on nala being a super hero...she was not the main premise of the movie and they made it so to fit person playing adult nala.
93154,The lion king is one of the best Disney movies
93155,Loved it. Don't listen to the butthurt critics. Don't know what they were expecting.
93156,If you love the original Lion King you will appreciate how they have recreated it.  You will always love the original because it is the the original but its pretty amazing how lifelike they made this one look.
93157,This whole movie was amazing. A must see. Will definitely see it again.
93158,"Not as awesome as the Original, however i loved it."
93159,Such a wonderful movie!  It followed the original story to the T!  The creative photography was exceptional!  The animals were so real!  It keep us on the edge of our seats even though we knew the story!  There were tears and laughter!  We took our grandkids!  Everyone loved it!!!
93160,Love everything about it ~ 
93161,"I felt like I was in the second grade again, sitting in the theater in awe. Still hits all the feels and added some great new stuff with Timon and Pumbaa. I fell in love again."
93162,"I like that the movie used VR and created some realism for the characters. However, I disliked the fact that scar was not dark & scary Be Prepared was not as powerful as the original the characters were over singing (runs etc and trying to be distinct) the hyenas missed Whoopis voice Rafiki was low key and didnt hit Simba over his head the animals didnt bow in respect to baby Simba Nalas Voice was annoying (Love Beyonc though) Can you feel the love tonight was sang to early in the scene when Nala first reunited with Simba. However, the soundtrack with its powerful Afro beats is great. Just wished the movie kept the same feel as the original. Even my 8 and 12 year olds who watch the original with me, thought this remake missed the mark."
93163,I absolutely loved the movie
93164,"It was almost identical to the original, which I loved! Brought back childhood memories of my favorite Disney movie!"
93165,Beautiful telling of a classic story.
93166,Loved the 2019 Lion King in 3D! My husband and I are in our 50's and would definitely see this again!
93167,It was okay. Not great. The original was much better.
93168,Original is much better
93169,"It wasn't BAD, it just didn't have the same soul and punch and the original.  Part of it is I think that it dragged on too long -- the Lion King is not meant to be longer than 1.5 hrs."
93170,My family and I absolutely loved this movie 
93171,"I love the visuals, the music, the characters and the setting. I‚Äôve seen the original lion king when I was a kid and watching it as an adult, it just brings it to life. Love scars voice as well, that was cool"
93172," Just a soulless, lifeless reboot that ruined everything likable about the original. The film has good effects but it doesn't save the film from being bland and emotionless. Rotten Rotten remake."
93173,Lionking was The Lion King it wasn‚Äôt nothing special about it All they did was trying to sell Beyonc√© and Beyonc√© was in it only for 30 minutes other than that it was the same Lion king special-effects didn‚Äôt make different The singing was out rages in a bad wayThey should‚Äôve just left it alone let  as a cartoon I love Disney a lot but sometimes they go overboard
93174,it was a fairly good movie a little slow and a few places I don't really think that young children would enjoy it this is a movie made for adults
93175,I took my 7 and 10 year old to see it.  My oldest loved it.  My younger said she liked it but likes the original animated version better.  It was visually and audibly beautiful.  A fun remake that we enjoyed.
93176,I love the original but thought this movie will bring families together to discuss differences/similarities. Graphics were great and the message never gets old! I will probably go see it again bc Im sure there are some things I missed the first time around.
93177,A huge classic that was redone to perfection.
93178,"Awesome movie! The CGI was amazing and the characters were fun to watch. I still love the original, but I love this new version as well."
93179,Faithful to the original. great animation technology
93180,"The Lion King was a great movie. It was as good as the first if not better based on the quality of the film! Thumbs up again, Disney!!!!"
93181,Live action remake was awesome!!!! The roar was fantastic!!!!
93182,i loved the lesson of friends and family and the power of growth in maturity and it's process.
93183,The Lion King remake was amazing! It looked so realistic and there was some humor in the movie that made you love the characters even more!
93184,"Loved. It. All.  Amazing!  I'd see it again, and again, and again."
93185,Nothing will compare to the original but I did like it. It was as good as a remake could be.
93186,I love how they stuck to the original storyline and the visuals are stunning
93187,I love the original. So I was already going into this new one a bit skeptical. I must say Billy Eichner and Donald Glover really surprised me. But the voice acting wasn't really the greatest. I was happy they used the original soundtrack. Obviously update a few of the songs with the new cast but most of the original scores were used. Overall it was great.
93188,"The Lion King is plagued with unoriginality, but still comes out victorious with stunning visuals, a great story, and great voice acting. "
93189,My bad my son didn‚Äôt like it at all!
93190,"Saw the cartoon version more than 20 years ago, even bought the DVD. There is no comparison to be made. This remake stands alone as an original composition of qualities that resonate of 21st technological advances in animation and CGI images. the entire viewing time debating whether the filmmakers used real animals in some scenes. AWesome story updated for a new generation. sings and singing were spectacular."
93191,"I hated that they tried so hard to be different from the original yet filmed scene by scene like the original!!! Their idea of changing it up was changing little words that had me say why not just use the actual script ? I know Lion King scene by scene word by word ... for example the scene after Mufasa saved simba from the hyenas , in the original mufasa tells zazu to ""take Nala home"" but in the remake he says "" take nala back to pride rock."" WHY !!!! It was ALOT of that throughout the movie that I found pointless... if it's that important that you have to scramble a few words why do the entire movie 90% like the original!!! I would have respected it more if it was EXACTLY like the 1994 film , script and all. That would have been suitable because everything else set aside I enjoyed seeing actual animals re-enact. It would have just given another perspective of a classic. Scene by scene just set the anticipation of knowing what words are going to be said but then being disappointed when they weren't used. It was let down after let down!!! Don't even get me started on Beyonc√©... Beyonc√© was just Beyonc√© not a believable nala at all!!! Beyonc√© will always only be able to be Beyonc√© she's NEVER been an actor!!! I was HORRIFIED at can you feel the love tonight... It was just Beyonc√© singing like Beyonc√© ,no character.    I'm sorry for so many Beyonc√©s but that's ALLLLL her casting was!!! She was DEFINITELY the worse! The opening was honestly the best part because I still had a sense of hope. Matter of fact when it first came on with the mouse I was ALL in!!! Everything was beautiful,the detailing was magical , even scar made a grand entrance! I said to myself if this movie is ANYTHING like the opening it's going to be phenomenal and those critics don't know what they're talking about. I hate to admit they were right üòñ save your money and rewatch the original and appreciate ALL its glory because it truly doesn't get any better!!!"
93192,"I like how in some ways it stayed true to the original, but I was waiting for Timon to dress in drag and do the hula. Just missed some key parts that would have been nice to see"
93193,I liked that they Didn‚Äôt change the story line the special affects were amazing
93194,"Dark, literally and figuratively.  
We are in sun and sand. Most parts are lit so poorly that it's nearly impossible to make out the check clears. 30 minutes too long. I've never seen so many people get up and go to the restroom during a movie like they did in this one.  Not to mention the graphic violence of what appears to be real animal attacks and killings. Facial expressions of the original characters are gone in favor of real looking animals. Jon Favreau should never be allowed to direct a Disney movie again."
93195,New digital technology.  it looked natural.
93196,liked new changes from animation but could have done better with the hyenas
93197,I love everything about the movie. The animation was so detailed. I would watch it again.
93198,The movie is visually stunning and the story stays true to the original. The emotional connection to the original carries through. My wife and I really enjoyed it.
93199,Very well done and a great modern remake from a timeless story 
93200,It was a great movie.
93201,"The original 2D version is superior in every way from voice acting to artistic style to the music. All the surreal fantasy is sucked out of it, which ruins the musical moments. The new movie is good for a generation that rejects 2D and needs everything CGI. It was a bore fest for me but I grew up with the original. "
93202,"Imagine giving an artificial intelligence the script for The Lion King and having it remake the movie. The Lion King 2019 is what it would make. Soulless, lacking emotion and just a pale comparison to the original in every way possible. I don't know if I have ever left a movie feeling angry at a studio for making a film. 

Skip this movie, skip it in the theater, skip in on streaming and just skip giving Disney any money for this travesty. 

I gave The Lion King my first F of 2019. "
93203,This was an overall great family movie.
93204,Everything youd expect plus more
93205,I really liked it. It looked so life like. Most of it was like the original. There were a few scenes that were different.
93206,"I would have given it 5 stars, however Disney adding Beyonce was a wrong move. Pushing Beyonce down our throats is the only thing that I resented about the movie; however, other than Beyonce, Disney did a good job with the movie. A few more things is I that I wish they chose another voice for Simba, and some scenes, for example, Scar getting killed by the hyaenas was more epic in the original (as it had a more iconic shadow scene.) "
93207,The original still better. Loved the Graphics 
93208,Not even close to the first one. Disappointed.
93209,It was redone beautifully and was very refreshing to see on the big screen again.  Such a classic movie.  Must see.
93210,"Loved how it was super close to the original! loved the voices, but also missed Whoopi and the hula dancing! Beautiful picture, animals and cast!"
93211,Wonderful! Worth the money to see it in IMAX 3D.
93212,Great movie!! Pretty much stuck with the original cartoon movie!!
93213,"The movie had too much animal violence! Very disturbing, Ive been to Africa many times and the violence was totally  unrealalistic !"
93214,This was an awesome remake enjoyed it.
93215,Yes! Loved it! As a African American this had much meaning and message to me! 
93216,Good movie my grandson sat and watched it.
93217,"Real good movie. Great effect, with the animals."
93218,I like everything in movie
93219,the movies was not exciting because nothing was different from the original. they claim it would be more realistic but if that were the case once mufasa died scar would be the rightful king like in the wild. the characters are also very boring and seem to have no emotion 
93220,Too much realism with voice movement. Kind of lame. Original was much better 
93221,Would‚Äôve been perfect without Beyonc√©‚Äôs awful acting skills
93222,Love that they kept their original music
93223,Great remake of the original! Loved every minute of it!
93224,"The original animated movie was as close to a perfect movie as possible.  Since it's so hard to improve on perfection, the only thing that was left to do for the new movie is to improve the visuals.  Everything else is almost identical to the original from the story to the amazing Hans Zimmer score.  Although the CG animation is amazing, it's still distracting some times as you can't help but realize that what you're watching isn't real, but it sure is close!"
93225,"It's almost the same thing as the original movie -except it's live action. Doesn't add anything new to the story, but if you're a huge fan of the animated movie (or the broadway musical) you should watch it."
93226,"Took my 4 year old Grandson, and we both loved it. He stayed attentive through the whole movie. Great soundtrack and visuals."
93227,"Great movie, my wife and daughter really love it as well"
93228,loved this new version.
93229,Critics are nuts! It was epic!!!
93230,"The visuals are very impressive, which is the only thing impressive about this film. None of the songs, nor the voice acting has any of the same spirit as the original film. There is very little excitement in the voice acting and the singing falls on flats from the equivalent of a rehearsal from someone who might had tried to audition for the parts. The biggest failing was during the song ""Be prepared"" which is done in an spoken word variant of the original with none of the same tenacity spanning as the original gave us. While the visuals were great, they were too great. No emotion can be made from the lions faces or any other animal which is what should had made the voice acting so important which is largely left forgettable. "
93231,"dialogue felt forced/rushed, something just felt odd about it"
93232,Loved it!! Very well done.
93233,Just like the original. It was amazing!!
93234,was a good movie. changed a few things but still a good movie.
93235,I thoroughly enjoyed it
93236,"They did a great job at perfectly molding the realistic version of all of the characters, yet keeping to the original storyline. only a few minor differences but in my opinion perfectly orchestrated!"
93237,Was well worth seeing
93238,Missed Whoopi as the hyena.
93239,"It relies so heavily on the nostalgia of the original to fill in the emotions of scenes that wouldn't otherwise register without that reference point. For example, Mufasa's death never hits the emotional core and feels odd when the voice actor is crying and a closeup of young Simba is not even close to matching that emotion"
93240,"Was very true to the original story line, but was missing ""something"".  Overall very good."
93241,this was a grate time
93242,"Critics are stupid, this was anamazing movie."
93243,Fantastc. Best disney I've ever seen
93244,It was a fantastic remake. the graphics and animations was A+
93245,"The new Lion King is amazing! I am a lover of all things Disney.  I loved the 1994 Lion King and love the new Lion King.   

The imagery was stunning!  Absolutely breathtaking!  The backstory in the new Lion King adds more vivid imagery and explanation.   I was happy to see Disney did not stray from the powerful beginning and ending.  Adding the lionesses at the end to fight with Simba, along with the explanation Cerabe states to scar, is a wonderful addition!  

Way to go Disney!  A must see for anyone who loves the Lion King!  "
93246,"I am going to be honest, i was angry while watching this movie. The script is just lazy and they changed so little and yet so much in the worst possible way. There is no emotion, no joy to be had but empty nostalgia. This movie is just awfull, but at least now i can apreciate the originall a lot more, because at least that movie gave a shit about being a good product and not just an obvious cash in on something that was already popular."
93247,Not quite as good as I was hoping.
93248,I liked the movie only thing I didnt like was that some of the songs from the original were omitted
93249,The movie it self was great and the CG is amazing! but for me they lost the main advise that the movie is supposed to communicate. The part where Rafiki tels Simba that the past can hurt but you can either run from it or learn from it.
93250,"It looked incredible and the music was phenomenal. Great nostalgia, but very copy and paste. But, hey, why go see a remake of Lion King if that's not what you're looking for. Shoutouts to the performances of Billy Eichner and Seth Rogan as Timon and Pumbaa."
93251,"The biggest downfall of this remake of the beloved story is the lack of emotional expressions from the characters. They should have pulled back on making characters look realistic and added more facial expressions which would have helped audience connect better with the characters. The remake feels more serious and lacks the comic relief that made the original entertaining and funny. Many songs lacked the emotion and enthusiasm that the original songs had. Beyonc√© however did a fantastic job singing her part. Simba, Timon and Pumbaa were wonderfully recreated while Rafiki's character was completely ruined in this remake. Overall, the movie is a digital masterpiece, but the lack of emotion makes the movie simply, boring.  "
93252,Amazing kept most of the original dialogue great graphics is a must see
93253,It really stayed true to the original film.. ‚Äúcartoon version‚Äù
93254,"Loved every second of it. Surreal to see your childhood movie come alive making it feel that much more raw. Definitely cried and felt every emotion, not sure if children would think it is too scary on certain scenes."
93255,good like the original
93256,Original is the best!
93257,"I felt like I was in Africa, it was so beautiful! Beyoncs sing Spirit was so moving!  The cinema was packed."
93258,amazing my childhood brought to life
93259,Lame. Very unemotional! 
93260,Really good movie! Bringing the characters to life made this a great movie
93261,"The animation lacked emotion, so did the voice overs. Boaring, to say the least..."
93262,No need to remake. Loved the animated version
93263,Great movie to see in 3D.
93264,"ES PERFECTA!!! 
Me encanto que respetaran la historia original y a un que no aparecen los momentos m√°gicos o de fantas√≠a, es una joya ver El Rey Le√≥n live-action muy bonita regalo para nosotros los fanaticos de esta pel√≠cula. "
93265,I LOVE THAT THE MOVIE WAS JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL!! !! üòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòä
93266,"Although I thought there may be some variations from the original and was a bit surprised that there werent any, I LOVE The Lion King! So, it was a win for me!!"
93267,Loved it! A little slow but incredibly beautiful!
93268,Great family movie. Kids enjoyed it
93269,Graphics were great but it literally was the same movie.
93270,Liked because it matched the GOP of the present
93271,"The music,the songs !"
93272,a must see. love the graphics and overall quality of the movie.
93273,"Loved the updated CGI version.  In my opinion this is not as YOUNG child friendly as the original and was lacking in the comedic relief that the original had.   Overall enjoyed with our grandchild (5 YO) She sang along, we all had moments!  Good times!"
93274,Loved it all great memories of my childhood
93275,I loved the movie that I kept dancing and singing in my chair!
93276,"I took my grandkids 
The movie brought back so many memories when my kids were young and we went to see the movie. I loved the 3D glasses 
This is a must see for children and adults"
93277,this was an amazing movie the reenacting was on point
93278,Such a wonderful rendition! Enjoyed it so much CRITICS ARE STUPID! Saw IMAX 3D
93279,My daughters ( ages 6 and 3) have been impatiently waiting to see this movie and let me tell you it was amazing! The girls loved it and can't wait for it to come out on DVD. Definite must see!
93280,Cinematography was UNBELEIVABLE!
93281,Hands down! Great movie!!
93282,"i know that they wanted to be realistic, and animals can't climb on each other  but at least at ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"" they could have edited some different animal scenes, but is so boooring. all animals standing still. in ""Hakuna Matata"" they jus walk signing. They coul have jumped in the river what so extravagant about that?? But nothing. This movie is souless. Disappointing"
93283,Wonderful. Just filled with everything that made the original great!!!! Music and everything was great!!!
93284,It was a breathtaking movie to watch! Loved every minute of it! Only reason my rating is 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because none of the animals had genitals. 
93285,This was my childhood brought ti life i am glad i got to share this with daughter.
93286,It was a great movie like always but nothing compares to the original.
93287,I loved it!! Perfect humor and totally held the integrity and expectations of the original.
93288,AMAZING MOVIE..MADE ME FEEL LIKE A KID AGAIN
93289,awesome movie it's a must see
93290,Visually stunning but it feel way too long. Too many walking scenes and they cut out many lion king quotes. They shortened be the song prepared and sang can you feel the love tonight in the middle of the day. I left the theater very disappointed because I loved the original.
93291,Forgettable with incredible visuals.
93292,same story as the original but what more can you want from a classic. especially live action. amazing
93293,It was amazing the animals looked amazing. my kids loved it.
93294,Impressive picture quality. A nice refresh of the story graphics.
93295,"Absolutely love it. My children all had a smile on there faces and enjoyed singing along with the movie, as well as the adults in the theater. brings back good memories."
93296,"Original is better, new music isn't great"
93297,"It isn't as good as the animated but who really thought it was, but don't listen to the critics the get paid to write crap and sometimes can't see the great in things. The only thing I saw wrong was the casting of Beyonc√© it was a mediocre choice. "
93298,"It was scene by scene, an exact copy of the original, minus the facial expressions. No surprises at all."
93299,I loved it!  Absolutely enjoyed this movie.  Not sure why people are saying it‚Äôs not good or animals don‚Äôt look realistic!  It was a fantastic movie and I wouldn‚Äôt change a think about it!
93300,Overall it was a great movie and Disney did a fantastic job of recreating the Lion King into a real life version! Highly recommend to go see it!
93301,The music is fantastic. The animals look so real. Movie magic.
93302,"We lived the movie, it was very close to the original version and even though we knew the outcome of the show it was still a wonderful version!!!"
93303,The movie was great but the singing could have been better.
93304,I told my daughters and they loved it. It was really amazing how they did with live action ani.animals.
93305,It had its moments but I like the original bet
93306,Great movie.  Well done.
93307,The Movie was awesome
93308,I love that the movie stayed true to the original movie/story line! The movie was great!
93309,"It was ok, but I was just a little disappointed with the music."
93310,I don't see what the critics don't like. I enjoyed it.
93311,Loved the movie. Invoked feelings of old. James Earl Jones's voice was great to hear again. Well done once again.
93312,"Disney has lost the magic.
In making this original into a life-like story, they confined the story to realism. That means much of the emotion, comedy, and movement of all the characters is restricted to what an actual lion would do. Mufasa dies and Simba's grief just isn't communicated to the audience. This also breaks immersion as I often found myself thinking these are talking cats and the communication just isn't there. 

It's fair, I suppose, to judge the story by itself and not compared to the original. But even in doing that, the character's movements are stiff, the emotions are dry, and the songs are empty. The best part is just how amazing the CGI is, but that's really where it ends. 

I recommend passing on it. "
93313,"I liked the movie. It was an exact remake of the original, but I liked the original soundtrack better than the new one. I found myself comparing it and have to say that all though the CIG was great, I liked the original better."
93314,Realistic animals yet missing something
93315,An absolute throw back to the beautiful story that we all fell in love with. brought a smile to me an my wife's faces.
93316,Horrible voice acting... Beyonce was a terrible Nanla. I was bored almost the whole movie. I love the original Lion King.
93317,Not as colorful as the cartoon. I liked the creativity and the three D. Was awesome and lived it.
93318,I really enjoyed the rehash of the movie. I watched this movie when I was a little girl and now I'm taking my kids to see it.
93319,"Solid retelling of a classic story. Felt forced, however, and I didn‚Äôt love the new Young Simba‚Äôs voice. I HATED Nala‚Äôs (Beyonc√©‚Äôs) voice. She cannot act, even as an animated character, and it felt as though she was just reading from a script. Only saving grace was Billy Eichner‚Äôs Timone."
93320,Disney sure has another winner with this reboot!
93321,"The new Lion King was truly an amazing movie experience!! My wife and I watched the original movie dozens of times when our children were young 20 years ago, and this brought back all those memories and more!! Highly recommend seeing this movie, whether you have kids or not!!"
93322,"This movie produced by Jon Favreau was absolutely amazing!! He did justice to my childhood nostalgia, while he made the movie his own. I absolutely loves the care and respect he gave to the original while promoting new characters that were not far deviated from their original counter parts. I would watch this movie 100% over, best live action to come out so far next to jungle book, which not surprising he also directed. I think this movie was what the remakes like Beauty and the beast, Dumbo, Winnie the Pooh and Aladdin should have been."
93323,"As a huge lion king fan my opinion on the film may be slightly bias, but I feel like it's a great movie. They didn't change much and with new technology, Disney and Jon Favreau were able to beautifully recreate pride rock and entire African savannah. Probably the only thing I didn't like about this (and other previous live action Disney remakes) is the fact that the characters just seem to be mimicking the exact same lines as the original verses making them their own. With the exception of Chiwetel Ejiofor who does a phenomenal job as Scar in my personal opinion. Overall, The Lion King is a great movie and if you love the original as much as I do you definitely will be satisfied, or not because I know some of you guys are die hard purist üòÇ."
93324,LOVED IT!!!!! ‚Äú20 years in the making‚Äù Was wonderful & spot on!!!!!!
93325,Great movie wish I voice acting was as good as the original tho...
93326,"graphics were great, the movie was done well."
93327,This Tuesday night 730 or 7 pm 
93328,Pretty much a new version of the original nothing really new except most of voices are current talent.
93329,I enjoyed it as much as the original. The effects were so good that I didn't even see them as effects. Lighting and camera angles were great. I was so glad that James Earl Jones returned for this one!
93330,"I have already had the opportunity to see the movie and I want to tell you a little review about the new movie of The Lion King. And I can tell you, it's a work of art. Very faithful to it's original version, plus it includes some other new scenes (and characters) that fit perfectly with the story. Each beloved character was developed to perfection. And finally it is worth mentioning that something that I loved was the soundtrack by the same composer of the first film (Hans Zimmer) It's almost like an updated version of the soundtrack of the animated film. In conclusion, I would call it an audiovisual masterpiece. There is no doubt that this movie is a roller coaster of emotions. From my point of view, this film has perfected the animated version that came out in 1994. Without hesitation it has been worth the price of the ticket and these three years of waiting that I have been doing since it was announced (Months after the premiere of the Live- Action from The Jungle Book)"
93331,It was a very great film tbh with you. The only negatives I have is the lack of compassion of several scenes but they're being realistic about what animals can and cannot do just like the original classic film. I'm very quite impressed of the singing scenes. It's almost exactly like film except the passion & facial expressions that's all. Very fun & happy film for all ages. I really enjoyed it including my family. I hope y'all enjoy it as well.
93332,Timon and Pumba were funny
93333,Absolutely stunning!
93334,I felt like a 20 yrs old again!!! Its was moving and tastefully done!
93335,Overall Loved the movie.  It was not necessary for Simba to have blue eyes.  Little suttle things come actress as racist!
93336,Awesome remake of one of our favorite Disney movies 
93337,A visual feast -  excellent remake.  For big kids (adults) and little kids alike -
93338,it made me cry and laugh. great soundtrack!
93339,This was an excellent remake if an old classic.  Brought back so many wonderful memories.  I will be seeing again.. Soon
93340,The most powerful statement of the movie was removed.
93341,Even better than the original.
93342,I wished the females of the movies got more of a voice
93343,"A mist see for all ages.  Pack the cars, trucks, Van's and just go.  Buy your tickets online and skip the ticket counter."
93344,"Absolute trash, only decent thing was mufasa and that's because the voice was original. Wouldn't waste my time watching this on Netflix "
93345,Love the original  better .The movie seem to be to dry and rushed but beyonce did a good job on her part.Some songs didnt sound all that  do to not enough effort.
93346,Horrible.  A good movie ruined.   Too many critical and loved scenes and characters changed. Or removed completely.  
93347,it was african SUFFeR_I
93348,"This movie was terrfic, wonderful, heart warming, movie that needs to be seen by everybody so awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
93349,"The movie is worth seeing. The scenery was great and the live action was good. The big piece for me was Scar- Jeremy Irons and James Earl Jones are the most iconic voices of the original - they should have recasted both. Scar just wasn't nearly as menacing or memorable in the new version.  I do think the original is much better- the characters being animated can have more expressions, some scenes are better in the original like the Graveyard enemies and ""Be Prepared."" 

But there's so good things I liked in this version too. I liked in the new place they had other animals - always thought it was weird in the original it was just Simba, Pumba, and Timon. 

It's not the original and it never was going to be. But I think Scar has me the most set back. I felt the casting for everyone else was good!"
93350,Everything I want all my kids and grandkids to see it!
93351,Loved the real life instead of animation like the original.
93352,"It was very good. I was glad that they kept it very similar to the original. There were very minor differences, mostly just in verbiage. My whole family went (Mom, Dad, Sister, Brother in law, two nieces (15&8), cousin, aunt and myself). Our age range was 8 to 64 and each one of us really enjoyed the movie."
93353,"Another live action remake, another disappointment. Gr8 CGi tho"
93354,Its wonderful! Just like the original!
93355,the movie was awesome! the soundtrack was amazing!
93356,Great live movie of a childhood memory
93357,almost as good as the original..  almost.
93358,"Like watching a band cover your favorite song. No matter how much polish or style is in play, nothing beats the original. This Planet Earth like epic has a great voice cast, it's stunning visuals soar and are the kind of achievement that could revolutionize the film industry for years to come. Even as awe-inspiring as the visuals are, the animals aren't particularly relatable or easy to connect with due to the lack of really emotive creatures on screen. Liked Jeff Nathanson's emphasis on humor in this screenplay. As much as I love The Lion King, a sense of wit is missing from the original. Han Zimmer's score might be one of the best ever. Zimmer updates his score a bit while maintaining its brilliance. Props to director Jon Favreau and the visual effects team for building a truly magnificent looking world, but this film sacrifices emotion for visual splendor and that's what is holding it back from being truly great."
93359,Incredible special effects!
93360,Loved the music. Still a Great story. Animation was fantastic.
93361,The visuals were amazing.
93362,"almost shot for shot remake, not a bad movie, the emotion from the original is sacrificed to the realism"
93363,"I was very skeptical about this movie,  I'm so glad I watched it!"
93364,The movie lacjed the comedy the hyinas brang in the original movie.
93365,The movie was absolutely amazing!!!
93366,Awesome.  The music  was fantastic
93367,Loved it and it was so real. Took me back to my childhood.
93368,I loved everything about it.
93369,Movie was amazing. Met all of my expectations. Followed the original movie perfectly!
93370,The movie as a whole was just amazing. The work that went into it and all the stars that played their parts so well was wonderful. They did a fantastic job. I have no idea how they did that with all the animals but it was great.
93371,Visually stunning! Loved every moment.
93372,need real voice actor. the original is way better
93373,Great that they didn't change much. Very nostalgic.
93374,"I loved it, they did a WONDERFUL job with this Disney movie!"
93375,Watching the Lion King gave me a feeling of euphoria.
93376,"Went with younger children, 10 and 8.  They loved it.  I am partial to the first one. 
 I missed the orginaal voices so glad James Earl Jones was init.  Kids loved the animals.  ."
93377,My family and I enjoyed it!! It warmed my heart to see my niece and nephew enjoy the movie like I did as a kid!! I recommend this movie for anybody!!
93378,"It was great ... but let's be honest here ... people who are writing bad reviews are butthurt cause they made a remake. Storyline was the same , animation was great, beyonce voice was annoying per usual ü§£ but it was cute and it's made for children so adults should stop reviewing it. . People focusing on the negative instead of appreciating the cast and the technology that has revolutionized the film industry... ok I'm done !!! Lmaooooo"
93379,great movie! kept it original!
93380,"Fantastic movie!! Loved it, nothing was wrong with this movie. Everything was on point. Would see it again, and would recommend it also."
93381,I loved the Lion King!  The real look of the animals playing the characters was the best!  The baby lions were adorable!
93382,"Missed some of the beauty of the original, but a great live action rendition!"
93383,"This was absolute garbage. My friend and I left after Hakuna Matata, making this the first movie either of us have ever walked out on. The voice actors did a great job and were full of emotion, which made it even more surreal and unpleasant that the CGI animals looked so expressionless. They cut memorable lines and replaced them with nothing of substance, which is baffling when you consider how long this film is. Be Prepared is turned into a MUCH shorter spoken-word solo for Scar, Shenzi is made the serious and severe leader of all the hyenas while Ed has been replaced with another hyena who talks (ruining the dynamic between the three). And I didn't see this part myself, but I hear ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" is entirely done in the middle of the day. Astounding. "
93384,The Lion King is a classic! Being able to watch a movie that I loved as a kid with my children was awesome. We all enjoyed the movie and the 3D effects as well. Its a great way to get all the family together! Thank you remaking this!
93385,"realistic animals with blank expressions delivering human emotions just didn't work, also why were timon and pumba such dicks"
93386,"Absolutely great for all ages.  The animals, so life like, make us believe they really do talk."
93387,"I loved EVERYTHING about this remake! It was amazing, beautiful, and funny. Dont base your decisions on good or bad reviews on this wonderfully made adaptation to a beloved classic. If you love Disney, go watch this movie. You wont be disappointed."
93388,It was a great movie
93389,"I almost walked out of the theater during the scene was Simba and Nala meet again in the forest. It was that bad. The fact that this audience score is at 89% tells you something about the state of consumer sophistication in regards to film. It's low - and no one I know would call me a film snob. Timon and Pumba were by far and aware the strongest part of the movie. The rest was a nice looking pile of nothing. A remake of the original that is worse. Donald Glover and Beyonce are horrible voice actors, great at other things but voice acting is it's own art and they haven't mastered it."
93390,Exactly what I was hoping for and better...  I am sorry the critics continue to be way off in their understanding of quality movies
93391,Loved the movie not a fan of Beyonc√© however
93392,"I was hoping this version would be different than the animated Lion King, so I was a bit disappointed. The rest of my family raved about how great this movie was, however, so I defer to their sentiments in my rating. My favorite scene involved new content, so I won't spoil that experience for others--but it was great!"
93393,"Boring, unnecessary, and they should have gotten real voice-actors to do the main characters's lines. Timon and Pumba stole the show, because everything else was dreadfully boring."
93394,Meh - original was better
93395,"The animals and scenery was nice the story was backwards, the singing was off I prefer the original there was no morning report song scar was talking the song and not singing simba was doing a lot I didnt like it"
93396,Nice movie to watch together with family and friends.
93397,Amazing graphics and wonderful voices. Enjoyed seeing this movie with our kids 24 years later. A very nostalgic moment for our family.
93398,Lackluster and boring. Visuals great but characters much to be desired
93399,I always like lion King movie ..(the original) this version is a little different but I enjoy so much with my family .. I recommend.. thanks
93400,Loved it!!! So many memories watching this with my kids just as I watched it for the first time with my parents. Beautifully done!!!!
93401,Horrible movie! Voices were weak. Best part was the cgi.
93402,I enjoyed this movie. went with my grandchildren of 11 and 8 yrs old. they also enjoyed. Wasn't exactly what I expected. But it is still a Must See Movie.
93403,"Loved every second, and didn't even mind the re-imagining of Be Prepared even though the original version is one of my favorite Disney songs ever. The characters had heart, the movie was shot beautifully, and it was a beautiful reimagining of a film i always loved."
93404,"I found the animation beautiful, but much too realistic for taking animals. It became more of a distraction. Like watching a PBS documentary only where the animals break out in a song and dance. The movie overall was an exact replica of the old one. I guess Disney wanted to really show off what theyre animators can do now. Having recently watch the new Toy Story, I found that movie much more entertaining."
93405,True to the original with awesome graphics!
93406,awesome movie! 3D is a must
93407,Fantastic take on the classic.  even more emotional
93408,Nothing different than the old one.. Each scene dialog and don't was copied over.. Totally disappointed!!
93409,Lion King was a great movie; if it was your first time seeing it. Other than the orignal story it either is on par or even diminshes the art of the orignal movie. The new animations were beautiful overall and this movie is a good watch for those who either haven't seen the film before or those who want to enjoy how far cinematography has come. 
93410,The movie looked so real like if they were filmed in real life followed the story line like the original
93411,"Awesome movie, super cute!!! Cannot wait to watch it again"
93412,"Big fans of the original. Besides the upgraded graphics, the 2019 version was very disappointing. Voice choices, jokes, timing all fell flat. Could have been so much more with Jon Favreaus directorial talents but something went wrong...Almost like everyone was just going through the motions for a paycheck. : (("
93413,I liked everything. But Im use to my animated version
93414,Really Loved the intensity...Great movie!
93415,I thought the animated version was a better movie. More enjoyable
93416,Disney is destroying what made it Disney!!! Not only did this feel like a discovery channel ‚ÄúFollow the animals in their natural habitat documentary‚Äù it also was boring to pieces!!!! WHY RUIN A FILM THAT WAS RESPECTED FOR THE STORY AND THE ANIMATION???? All critics have even seen that Disney is recreating a few of the animated films- LEAVE ‚ÄúMulan‚Äù and all the rest alone!!!!!!!!!! You are only going to see a large opening and then crappy reviews that will lose the money you thought you would make. PLEASE STOP KILLING THE STORIES WE LOVED AND.... WRITE NEW ONES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Until next time- Only the bad shall fear my name.
93417,The funny parts of the movie werent funny. Most of the jokes fell flat.  Scars voice wasnt as menacing as the cartoon which really hurt the overall feel.  Overall it wasnt great but still worth seeing during a matinee.
93418,Just like the cartoon movie
93419,HUGE DISNEY FAN AND THATS HOW A REMAKE SHOULD BE DONE üíï
93420,It was absolutely beautiful ü¶Å
93421,It could‚Äôve been better
93422,Awesome I like Lion King!!ü§ì
93423,Was everything I expected and more. Love the characters and the passion they played. 
93424,"O filme √© incr√≠vel e √© nost√°lgico pois nos traz a sensa√ß√£o da inf√¢ncia novamente. dire√ß√£o, fotografia e escolha do elenco para as vozes dos personagens merecem os parab√©ns. "
93425,Wonderful adaptation!
93426,"I loved this live action version. Everything looked so real.,"
93427,Great live action film! Artistry was very well done and as realistic as it can get! I will go see it again and again!
93428,Holds true to the original movie. Like the updated CGI.
93429,"The imagery was fantastic but the scenes that we all love were not as touching. Mufasa's death, seeing Mufasa in the clouds, presenting the new prince were just lacking. The new songs were great."
93430,"If youre expecting the cartoon version...its defintely going to disappoint you...

The voices DO NOT match the characters and the singing was not done very well...the movie was dark (in colors) and sometimes it was hard to see all the details on the landscape."
93431,Amazing visuals with incredible detail. Loved it!
93432,The movie was a very good live action retelling of the animated original.
93433,"Brought back childhood memories, however 30 minutes into the movie my 8 year old looks at me and says this is boring is it going to get any better....."
93434,"Amazing ""realness"" of the animals. You could see the muscles move as the animals moved. Heartwarming story."
93435,"Loved it! A few slight changes but still incredible. The only disappointing thing was realizing James Earl Jones voice is not as strong as before. However, I am glad he was able to voice the part of Mufasa. I'm glad they chose to use his magnificent voice."
93436,"The graphis were great, but Gambino and Beyonces voice were very distracting during the movie, I honestly like the cartoon better."
93437,It was outstanding. it was like it was real. Can you feel the love tonight was better in the original movie.
93438,It was  a beautiful movie.  It honored  the original and the play very well.
93439,I love it! Super like it!
93440,"It was nostalgic, beautiful and inspiring. I enjoyed watching this version with my kids, after enjoying it for decades as an adult. Some of the jokes clearly land better in animated version,but that doesn't take away from the joy. The casting was perfect and I'd watch it again."
93441,It was great seeing the animated real animals!
93442,IT WAS AMAZING THE MOVIE KICKED ASS!!!
93443,It was a great movie
93444,"It was so good that the kid want to see it again. Me personally, I feel like some of the scenes was cut out especially the part with the laughing Hyenas. But I still liked it a lot and give it high rating for the enjoyment."
93445,Great effects and beautiful scenery
93446,Loved the nostalgic moments and the wonderful memories. It was just different enough but followed the original so closely. Added some updated language in some places to make it current but didnt stray too far like some remakes. Amazing effects and beautiful songs from amazing artists!  Cant wait to see it again!
93447,Beyoncs vioce over wasnt that good
93448,Really loved the movie! True to the original.
93449,Made it looked like the animals were really talking
93450,"The storyline and message was real, and the special effects were amazing! We love it."
93451,Antiquated story where royals rule over the people and men are leaders of women=hated it. Animation was incredible! Very violent!!!
93452,Amazing CGI. It looked real. The script was wonderful. Just a great adaptation of a classic!
93453,Not too many remakes can top the original! this movie delivers. The whole audience was into it which made it that much better. I still get goosebumps every time he takes his mantle on Pride Rock! Best family film of the year!!
93454,movie being almost Real
93455,"Awesome Movie!
I laughed and I cried. I want to go see it again!"
93456,"two full stars solely for excellent graphics and some new touch to the story line. i've watched the original movie probably a 100 times with my bro and sis,and now in my mid-30s, still know much of the original lines and songs, and most importantly, i know the characters.  i'm no producer or anything, but changing character personality is completely ridiculous. the worst was Nala. Beyonce... WTF? first of all, she's a horrible actress. second, couldn't she frikn watch the original movie and understand who Nala was? any amateur should know better. Scar was a totally different ""person"" as were zazu and the hyenas. why would you change the damn personalities, Disney?  seems disney was influenced by social pressures (e.g., feminism, etc.) and/or greed cuz they know most people are idiots and would waste their money on this and put out unintelligent, mindless praises.

you know what? i'm taking back half a star"
93457,Kids really enjoyed it and as an adult now 20+ years later...it still made me sad when Mufasa died.
93458,I love having it come to life with real animals. The music was real special and up lifting.
93459,"Loved the film. I cried, and laughed."
93460,This movie was amazing! I loved how true it was to the 1994 animation film. The great thing was although it included so many key features from the other one this film had pieces that made it uniquely it‚Äôs own. I will definitely see this film again. I can‚Äôt believe how real it looked. My heart fluttered when Mufasa died just like it did in the 90s. I‚Äôm so happy Disney brought this back for many others to enjoy!
93461,"One of my favorite sayings is ‚Äújust because you can, doesn‚Äôt mean you should.‚Äù And nowhere has this phrase been more appropriate than when describing Jon Favreau and Bob Iger‚Äôs The Lion King. Just because you can take a brilliant ground-breaking Disney Animated Classic and retell it scene for scene, word for word and song for song with CGI doesn‚Äôt mean they should have. No fooling around here, this is the most pointless movie the studio has ever released. Thankfully we have the AMC Movie Pass which made it easier walking out of the theater before it ended, something we have never done with any movie ever. The only possible upshot of the CGI LK and it‚Äôs slew of negative reviews is it will serve as a wake-up call to Bob Iger. Unless he changes the course of the company in whatever time he has left his legacy will only be one of acquisitions and ripping off original genius Disney classic films. "
93462,I loved every second of it‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
93463,"Didnt really enjoy it. Took my son hoping he would love it like i loved the original, but we both were left underwhelmed. It wasnt entertaining in some ways dry. The musical scenes were short with non interesting choreograph. Tomone and puma saved the film from being a complete disaster. My five year old son wanted to leave before movie was over."
93464,"Excellent, amazing animal interactions, even if cgi. Very much like the animated one."
93465,"This movie is very very similar to the original so I don't know why it gets slack by critics! I would be happy knowing my kids get to grow up with this version of the movie. Like the original, very funny, heartfelt, and the shots are outstanding. Great movie overall."
93466,Beyonce shouldn't have had so many talking rolls. The dialogue was too fast. No room for emotion. Left out so many key Comedy parts of the movie that makes it funny.  I felt like my childhood was robbed. Donald Glover was great. Great execution in vocals during Hakuna Matata!
93467,Great stayed true to original
93468,The animated version was much more lively.  Did like Scars performance.
93469,"I was crying at the opening sequence! Beautifully done! Loved seeing it played out with real animals, but disappointed it didnt keep some of the best lines from the original movie."
93470,Loved it as much as the original!
93471,"It keeps to the 1994 animated classic,
with a few minor tweaks."
93472,"Kids: 5 stars Dad: 3.5. Average: 4.25
Kids: everything!
Dad: voice tones didnt match with facial expressions. Facial features/expressions looked very flat when supposedly theyre singing their hearts out in love and in joy. 
Story: cant beat the story. Awesome in that sense.  I just think the live aspect of the movie was just too much for the animation."
93473,"it great, it has all the elements needed in a movie. a must see"
93474,It was a pleasure seeing it. 3d very realistic enjoyed by the whole family
93475,This movie was a work of art. I enjoyed every minute of it and I was captivated. The Lion King gets 5 stars from me ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êüòÅüëçüèæ
93476,üëç thought it would have a new story line but good version
93477,So good and true to the original.
93478,"Who cares if it is a scene by scene remake? After 25 years I need a rehash. And it is brand new to children. The animals were SO realistic. Just a beautiful remake. At the end, the theater burst into loud applause. I can't remember the last time I saw that happen."
93479,The movie seemed very drawn out and the music was putting us to sleep!
93480,Too much was changed the music sucked ass especially Beyonc!!!
93481,This does not hold up to the cartoon at all. This felt like a cash grab by Disney because they are running out of ideas for new movies. Some movies should never be remade and the remake Lion king is proof that. I can't verify my ticket because I watched it at the Cinema cafe in Clearwater Florida. not in the list 
93482,We loved The Lion King! Ill buy this one when it comes out for sale.
93483,"It was so incredible, the CGI was amazing.  It was entertaining and funny.  We watched it in 3D which made it all that more fun.  We had 6 adults, a3 year old, and a 6 year old.  We all agreed it was a terrific movie!"
93484,"Yes, it is different than the original and YES, you may miss some of the facial expressions, but it still shines. Some parts are more amazing and dramatic. You can't help but fall in love with Pumbaa. Seth Rogan as Pumbaa is a must-see.
Don't expect a replica of the original, but also don't listen to the critics. The movie is different, yet still amazing."
93485,Absolutely loved it. A huge dose of nostalgia and I ate every bit of it up. I would see it again in theaters and am planning on buying it.
93486,"I thought it was amazing, same story but with live animals. The method of watching the animals talk was very well done.  Anything was animated and or computerized   also was very well done.  I thoroughly enjoyed it very much."
93487,"I liked the whole movie as a whole,  It was for all ages and I will definitely see it again.  Family oriented movie that anyone that watches will never forget"
93488,It was an ok movie.  The original was better!
93489,"We were afraid this remake would ruin the original for us, but it only enhanced our love for it. They covered all the bases with some minor variations/improvisations (some good some not so good), but overall it was great! Highly recommend watching it."
93490,It gives you all the feels!!!!
93491,Great remake of a Disney classic!
93492,"Amazing!  I felt like a kid again.  Opening scene gave me chills!  In my opinion, it was the best live action Disney has put out so far.  Im curious if they will meet or pass it."
93493,Absolutely amazing!!!
93494,Incredible like the original!!
93495,Not so kid like more adult
93496,Great visually. But lacked all the heart.
93497,"Stunning visualization of a beloved classic. Other that the first song, it doesn't make you sing-along with the characters and of all the things Nala and Simba lacked chemistry. Loved pumba though"
93498,I preferred the original movie don‚Äôt get me wrong they did an amazing job making it....but I love the original movie more
93499,Nice job re-creating a classic
93500,Very impressed by what they did with the movie. Visually it was amazing! Some characters fell flat but a great cast overall. 
93501,Lion King was amazing !!
93502,I absolutely loved this movie!!!!
93503,VGI efgectd wete very well-done and the landscapes were beautiful The faces wete not as expressive as in the animated film.
93504,"The movie was everything we hoped for. My grandson was so excited and please to know and recognize every character from the previous Lion King. I love the fact the ""Beyonce played La La! I love James Earl Jones as the King Mofussa and all the stars who done the damn thing to make this movie enjoyable, kid friendly and fun!"
93505,It was good overall. Obviously not the same as the animated version but the exact same story line and songs.
93506,It was missing that special something. Very slow and lack of energy. Seemed very forced.
93507,I loved the Nala storyline!
93508,I liked the beautiful scenery. I disliked the flow of the movie. For whatever reason this new Lion King did not hit me near as hard as the original. Also (while very funny) Seth Rogan as Pumba is not anywhere near as good as a singer as those songs need.
93509,Lacks the soul of the original movie or the musical.  Unlike other recent Disney remakes this movie brought little new to the table and lost a lot of what made the original great.
93510,Absolutely Amazing movie.
93511,Scar was great and so did the visuals
93512,Pretty close to the original. Beautiful scenes
93513,Loved the cinematography!
93514,I truly enjoyed it...
93515,Disney really needs to keep some movies as cartoons. 
93516,The digital likeness of the animals
93517,"The original animated film holds a special place in my heart and mind but I thoroughly enjoyed what director Jon Favreau and co. have delivered. Despite being nearly a shot-for-shot remake (in terms of plot) with some special changes here and there, I felt the same bit of joy, sadness, suspense and happiness all over again maybe even more so with it being ""live-action."" I do wish there was more distinction in appearance between some characters of the same species like the hyenas and female lions. For instance, I couldn't tell Nala and Sarabi apart in scenes they share unless they weren't speaking. However, with movie being a photorealistic reimagining of the animation, the identical-ness makes sense given the same would apply for the real wildlife. As for the film's soundtrack, the voice cast, which consists of global recording artists, deliver worthy new renditions of the classic songs from the original film. Even Beyonce's original song ""Spirit"" fits perfectly with the story and the moment in which it is used. Also like the original, this film certainly has a high rewatch value as I just can't wait... to see it again."
93518,"While visually impressive, the film fails to deliver the charm that existed in the original. Felt like I was watching a national geographic show..."
93519,This movie was awesome! It stayed true to the classic and the imagery was beautiful.
93520,"This was so good!! It was only slightly different than the original, Timon and Pumba were cool. Movie went by what seemed way too fast. Almost rushed, but not quite. "
93521,"The opening scene brought me to tears with the frame by frame accuracy, but if you‚Äôre looking for a carbon copy of the original, this isn‚Äôt it. There were creative liberties taken with the script and the dramatic deliverance was flat. For crying out loud, TIMONE NEVER DRESSED IN DRAG AND DID THE HULA!! How do you cut that scene?? Beautifully rendered characters and landscapes, but the story doesn‚Äôt hold a cancel to the original."
93522,Love the movie and I wanted to sing-a-long out loud in the theaters. I can't wait to buy it on DVD.
93523,fun! respected the classic but with some updated humor.
93524,The movie was fantastic!! The graphics were out of this world!
93525,The movie was beautiful made it look so real the story was exactly like the cartoon
93526,It was great story told magnificently. The animals looked so real. It was amazing how technology has advanced! Great for all ages!
93527,"missing some scenes, but good"
93528,"Great movie, followed animated original. 
Some of the fighting scenes were a bit aggressive for younger children, but overall an excellent family film."
93529,"Not impressed with the voice of  Scar, especially the song ""Be Prepared""."
93530,This was so much more than I expected. STUNNING!
93531,Great movie to see in 3-D. Really enjoyed seeing!
93532,animation was amazing
93533,Animals were great and music was also great
93534,"A great little movie. I went into this with very low expectations, but was surprised at how good it was. The first half falls a bit short, but the second half, I would say, makes up for it. It sticks pretty close to the original in tone, and dialogue. Although there is a fair amount of ad lib, which falls a bit flat in my opinion, over-all it's not a huge problem. The soundtrack is great and the songs are alright I guess. The new animation looks amazing, but I found myself being distracted by it at times. Overall this is definitely worth a watch"
93535,"It was ok, but left much to be desired. I was glad they mostly stuck to the original animated version but it was somewhat boring at times."
93536,"The music, animation everything was simply beautiful"
93537,Loved the movie. It followed the original cartoon movie very well.
93538,"Acabei de assistir Rei Le√£o. Um filme desnecess√°rio, a falta de originalidade faz com que o filme seja totalmente descart√°vel. N√£o que o filme seja ruim, pois a hist√≥ria em si √© boa, todavia o filme √© s√≥ uma demonstra√ß√£o de como a tecnologia avan√ßou, A falta de estilo (n√£o vai nem pro c√¥mico, nem pro realista) ajuda o filme a desandar. "
93539,Amazing graphics but does not live up to the original. Their was a lack of emotion and energy.
93540,Some of the scenes in the animated movie were missing from this movie version.
93541,Overall I believe children will enjoy the movie.
93542,"Where do I even begin..... The opening scene was so sweet, gave me literal chills! The animation was breath taking! I truly felt like I was sitting in the middle of Africa! Timon and Pumbaa are hysterical! They‚Äôll make you LOL! Beyonc√©‚Äôs voice is true bae! If you don‚Äôt leave the theatre feeling this obsessed then go see it again!! Can‚Äôt wait to own it on DVD!!!!!!! "
93543,It was very accurate to the storyline but unique in its own way
93544,Awesome graphics and realistic animals talking with such emotion.  Loved it!
93545,"Excellent retelling. Loved it. I think the critics have something against Disney..,.must be jealous. A those who can‚Äôt do criticize kind of thing. Great acting and the cgi was amazing. It is a dark telling, so very young kids may get scared. "
93546,"It was absolutely incredible!! Only thing missing was Jeremy irons voice !! Still well worth seeing, audience applauded at the end in the theatre!"
93547,Love...Love...Love!!!
93548,It was amazing! A must see!
93549,The best way i can explain this remake is like a gymist is doing the best looking flip and then fall on the landing. This remake look visually amazing but it not enough to carry the movie expcially when you rush and take out very important scene and while adding new scenes that doesn't enhance the story at all. If you want to see the lion king save your money and just go and watch the original you're not miss much with this remake.
93550,liked that it was still the same music
93551,Enjoyed the movie. It was a bit long for my 5 and 6 year old granddaughters but when asked they both gave it a thumbs up.
93552,"Loved the animation, plot, 3D was fab!"
93553,Very well done. Too intense for young children though.
93554,CGI was amazing. Other then that I know it‚Äôs only a remake so we already know what happens in the story but literally it came to a point where it was the exact same movie as the original. Scenes and everything. Some stuff was very ‚Äúnonchalant‚Äù done and some 1 liners were horrible...‚ÄùLions Attack‚Äù lol. Other then that it was ok.
93555,As a lifelong lover of The Lion King I can confidently say this remake did the original justice. Obviously there were small differences but no one wants an exact cookie cutter remake anyway. The music in the 2019 version paid great homage to the original and made me feel like I was back in the 90s watching a movie on a VHS tape.
93556,It was very well done. And stuck to the original movie.
93557,it was totally awesome. I took my 5 year old grandson to see it and we had a very good time. wouldn't have traded it for anything.
93558,the visual effects were amazing but the acting was a little blah
93559,I nearly fell asleep through the first half .
93560,Best movie I've ever seen in my entire life. All of the critics are stupid. And wrong! It was perfect. They added and changed just enough. Perfect!
93561,Not as good as the original but still worth it.
93562,More awesome than I could have imagined!!
93563,This is still the best Disney movie of all time!
93564,Loved the cgi. Must watch in 3D.
93565,"Loved the Lion King.  Music, animals everything want to go see it again"
93566,Extraordinary movie!
93567,The music in this movie
93568,It was A W E S O M E!!!
93569,I love the movie! I love the life and the animals. It was a very good remake of the classic cartoon.
93570,"I think they did a great job if this had been the original, but it wasnt. The original Lion King was a classic and is hard to top. This is one of those classic you shouldnt try to remake"
93571,Took my grandkids and we all loved it!  Singing along with the songs with them was so fun!
93572,Loved!!!! Awesome remake!
93573,"Had there not have been a animated version, this movie would have been 5 stars. Since there was an animated version though, this one gets 4 stars. Its still a great movie, just not as good as the first."
93574,"I think they did a fantastic job recreating the original animated version. Beware, you do get the urge to sing the songs."
93575,Nostalgic.. Enjoyed every second of the flim.
93576,"Shouldve been left alone, original to iconic."
93577,Amazing visuals & stays true to form. There is also some great added humor. A lot of the new voice cast were great. While yet others were deffintley missed. 
93578,I loved the movie. Was amazing. Had some parts that weren't in the movie from the original but I would see it again and again.
93579,Loved he scenes of Africa.
93580,Awesome job on remaking this. Stayed true to the original!
93581,"It‚Äôs The Lion King. The same story you remember when you were a kid. No new take or reimagining as far as that goes. Imagine The Lion King meets Animal Planet and you pretty much get it. However, the photo-realism takes away from some of the magic of the original film. There were aspects of the story telling mechanics that just felt more impactful as they were depicted in the original that just sort of lost their emotional effect in this ‚Äúretelling‚Äù of the tale. The graphic design is breathtaking but I think the original was much more enjoyable. I hear say that this is meant for the new generation of viewers to enjoy but honestly, I think the 1994 film is just fine for your kids. Save some money and just watch it with your kids in the comfort of your own living room."
93582,Excellent movie that seemed lifelike on occasions.  Story line was as remembered.  I will watch this movie again!
93583,"Good movie. Beautiful scenes. Super funny because of Voice acting. But‚Äî the Original Lion King, 25 years ago will always have my heart!!!!"
93584,Goodm movie for the whole familu
93585,"Absolutely amazing, met all of my expectations"
93586,The remake ok but cant beat the original
93587,Not much different than the original. The film making  was brilliant but it‚Äôs not as good. If I never saw the original I would love it.  I give it a B
93588,"Classic, yet has a fresh appeal to it. Well done, Disney! Best remake so far!"
93589,Took the whole family and it was just a great movie
93590,Was amazed by the graphics. Loved the movie but with some of the violence I dont think it would good very young children because of the reality it might be upsetting to them.
93591,The hair scene that travel from simba to rafeke was too long
93592,"First of all, the special effects in this film are outstanding and you can see all of the effort that went into it. All of the animal's act like their actual animal counterparts if you saw them in the wild. Timon, voiced by Billy Eichner, and Pumbaa, voiced by Seth Rogen, stole the show in their scenes. They both were perfectly casted and brought some of the humour in this film. For the rest of the cast, I can't really say the same thing. Don't get me wrong Donald Glover/Childish Gambino, who voices adult Simba, and Beyonc√©, who voices Nala, did decent enough jobs with their parts and I could easily hear them with their parts but others just needed a change in casting. My main problem with the casting was with Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar I just couldn't hear him as the villain. Trust me I tried to forget about Jeremy Irons but I just couldn't. Jeremy Irons made this character iconic for a reason and I feel like if they got somebody else it would have been a bit better. This film added forty extra minutes on to the run time, probably to show off the effects, but you can feel it especially when they change something or add something in. For me, this happened at the ending where they changed not just one of the funniest scenes but also made a scene longer than it should have been. The songs in this version just didn't give off the same spectacle as in the original version. The original used the sets and lighting to help bring you into the numbers this one has nothing to make you interested in them. At certain points, the lighting would change for no reason. What I mean is that it would be Day time and then just a couple of seconds later it would be dark. But hey, at least we have another great score by Hans Zimmer. In the end, The Lion King (2019) just doesn't live up to the original. If nothing else is showing and you need to beat the heat this summer than go ahead and check it out but if not just stay home and watch the 1994 one. I give The Lion King (2019) a 5.5/10."
93593,"it was ok, for a classic i was waiting more."
93594,It was great and the music was tops.
93595,It was wonderful!  I'm 64years old and my husband and I saw the 7:45 show in 3D.  I'm not sure that the 3D made that much difference. It is so well done and the humor was great.  We read a not so great review in The Wall Street Journal and almost passed but I'm so glad we didn't.  I cant recommend it enough
93596,Only watch this if you've seen the original 1994 animated classic because I'd hate for this to be anyone's first experience viewing this masterpiece! This movie is a visual marbel but that's all it is nothing more nothing less! All this movie is is a shot for shot remake of the original with non of the soul or magic that made the original great!
93597,Bom porem o oeigibal ainda e superior 
93598,I LOVED everything about this movie! My whole family loved it!
93599,Very close to original! Music was great!! Loved it!
93600,"The visual effects are without a doubt the best part of this movie. Jon Favreau is a great guy and director but something about this production fell flat. I believe it had to do with the lack of energy with the voice over acting. James Earl Jones is awesome and so is Beyonc√©, however, everyone seemed to be less than enthusiastic about their rolls. Everyone going to see this movie isn't going to find out what happens but is going to relive our childhood and share it with our kids. The VFX team really did an awesome job though. Seth Rogen even seemed watered down. Let Seth be Seth. Something happened in production though had to of. You have all these amazing actors and voices that when you hear them at their best you can see their characters. Obviously this is why they were cast but they never had the opportunity to shine like we all know they can. "
93601,Masterfully redone. Don‚Äôt listen to the uppity ‚Äúcritics‚Äù this movie was spectacular.
93602,"The animated version of the film is my all time favorite movie. I was so excited did this, and was so disappointed. Beautiful film, but it was like a voice over on the national geographic channel. The music didn't even get me excited. Animals cannot emote, so even Mufasas death scene was so not emotional. Some things should be left alone. What happened to making original movies."
93603,It was everything I expected and some
93604,Fairly boring remake of such a great classic. Didn‚Äôt enjoy it as much I would of liked. Sad
93605,"The movie was good, but we liked the original movie better ( cartoon) ."
93606,"It was ok. Cant touch the original, especially musically. Why would you remake the Lion King if you couldnt bring something fresh and blow us away with the new one? Why bother?"
93607,"They did a good job, taking a cartoon and making it a movie. Eventhough I missed some of the iconic voices, such as Jeremy Irons and Nathan Lane, the overall casting was good."
93608,The lion king was great.But the timeskips were a little bit on the the edge
93609,I thought it was fantastic! It was so beautifully done and real looking! Down to the raindrops on Simba‚Äôs mane. I laughed and cried and would absolutely see it again! I just loved it! Props to the artists who created such an awesome film!
93610,So emotive and very beautiful. I love the story. It is awesome!
93611,"I loved it!  It.  It was so realistic that it was like seeing one of the old Disney nature movies --until the animals started to sing and dance.  Even so, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was the same and still different from the stage play and the animation movie.  Not much could spoil the wonderful music."
93612,I loved this movie. I saw it with my 6 year old and it felt like I was 6 again too. I would definitely recommend.
93613,Terrible just terrible!!
93614,"pretty much the exact same movie, only more realistic. Parents next to me had to take their young children out several time durring the movie, so if you have sensitive children, you may kust want to watch the original. several times they tweek predictable parts you are waiting for, and it added to the laughs. all in all a good job, but not as good as the original."
93615,It was just like the original and that's what I liked
93616,It was not like the cartoon version to me. I should have been like wow. Next time Ill wait for it to come on Netflix.
93617,Pretty much exactly as the animated version as i remember it. A few details changed but nothing drastic that would change the overall experience of the story. The only difference i really felt was the emotions were portrayed better off in the animated version than this new one. But overall very good.
93618,My husband and I liked it better than the original.
93619,good....original is better but good üòÄ
93620,"While I appreciated that it mostly stayed true to the source material, and I was impressed especially on the shot-for-shot first scene, the movie was just okay. It lacked some of the charm of the original. I didnt enjoy the talk-singing in Be Prepared, and I really hated that Can You Feel The Love Tonight? happened DURING THE DAYTIME! Seth Rogen was hilarious as Pumbaa though, and I liked the little nod to Beauty and the Beast. All in all, it was fine, but I was admittedly disappointed."
93621,It was done magnificently
93622,Lacked emotion and creativity. 
93623,A great re-teling of the original with a bit of new lines and material to make it surpring and interesting.
93624,I absolutely loved the movie. It had all the wonderful qualities that the original movie had. I thought the voice acting and singing were also amazing...not to mention the movie is stunning! Obviously nothing will ever be as good as the original.. but overall it was a great movie! 
93625,"I wasn't thinking I would like it , but wow was I wrong. one of the better movies I've seen this year"
93626,Me ha encantado. Pelicul√≥n
93627,"Ac was broken in the theater, had to wait an hour for another movie and seats were lost"
93628,"It was great. Both my wife and I loved it and we love the animated version as well. Very well crafted and beautiful to look at. Of course, I understand those that are comparing every moment but just relax and enjoy. Technically a marvel! "
93629,"It was good, obviously because lion king was amazing, but it was just the lion king from 1994 with a better picture. It was very emotionless and mono tone. Pumbaa and Timon were hilarious though."
93630,"Great movie, amazing effects, brings back memories"
93631,Some of the story line not followed would be my only dislike but over all was great
93632,"When you read about the movies heart above you have to wonder what that really means. But after seeing the movie today I figured it out. Most of the blame for the  films problems comes from it's director Jon Faverau who was only asked to do this version because of his experience on The Jungle Book. Faverau was a perfect pick for JB because his age is much closer to the actual Disney classic. In this case he was about 30 years too old. He removed some of the classic lines from the film that made it a huge hit and even removed a few of the memorable scenes that gave the original it's humor. This version is extremely bland with little humor to be found. Surprisingly I even found James Earl Jones to be below par for his epic voice as Mufasa. In the original he delivered lines as if he was actually in the role where here he just seemed to be reading them. Little things omitted like his word of ""brother"" in his fateful fall didn't have the same power as the original. I found the movie to drag and was no where close to the greatness the 1994 classic had. Was very disappointed!"
93633,Was great but never as good as the original!
93634,"Just like the classic, animations were incredible."
93635,It was an amazing movie and I was at amazed at the way it looked it made me feel like I was with simba the whole time I really recommend this movie
93636,"Good job to the animators.  Everything else sucked.  The voice actors inflcited no emotion into these characters.  If the emotion is going to be lacking because of ""realism"" than the actors better be able to supply the emotion and they didn't.  Even James Earl Jones sounded less than emotional.  Baby Simba should have had a catch in his throat trying to wake his dad up and instead that scene was boring and dry.  Scar lacked any of the wit, snark, or charm that his animated character had.  He just looked old as hell and was just cruel. The hyenas weren't funny in the slightest.  Beyonce's added song did not fit the scene.  All the added scenes were too long and pointless.  Did we need 4 minutes of a lock of hair traveling to Rafiki? I really didnt need to watch a dung beetle roll a ball of shit tbh.  This came off as a monotine nature documentry where nothing exciting happens.  "
93637,Great movie. I felt like a kid again singing along with the songs. Hakuna Matada...
93638,"Done better the 2nd time,  loved the technology!"
93639,Loved it and so did my girls
93640,Couldn‚Äôt stop singing along with the original songs. Sound and image were awesome!
93641,It was great. Stuck to the original but added a few new touches that were hilarious. GREAT movie!
93642,"It only suffers by comparison. You can't bash Disney on the technical aspects. The visuals are all stunning. The story is solid, classic even . If I put myself in the place of a young person who is not familiar with the 1994 animated version, and this would definitely be my Lion King. Because some of these voices  are super distinctive (John Oliver, Seth Rogen, Beyonc√©), I found myself trying harder to forget the famous person and lose myself in the performance. The same goes for some of the self-aware jokes. They take me out of the story a little bit. The headliner performances are great including Donald Glover (adult Simba), Alfre Woodard (Sarabi) , Florence Kasumba(Shenzi), JD McCrary (young Simba) and the irreplaceable James Earl Jones (Mufassa).  This is where thing diverge a bit for me. I debate whether I would like to have heard a Jeremy Iron reprieve Scar over Chiwetel Ejiofor's still perfectly good performance.  Rogen and Billy Eichner do kill it as Pumba and Timon.  For the first hour I was really aware of the technical CGI wizardry that director Jon Favreau and company are laying down, but eventually I did fall completely to the story telling spell. Would the exaggerated eyes and mouth movements, animal choruses and background changes of drawn animation be better? Was the old one simply more movie magical?  If you only had this one, you couldn't knock it. "
93643,Some movies just shouldn‚Äôt be touched.
93644,"it wasn't good but it wasn't bad either, I think the biggest gripe was that the previous entry you could feel and see the emotion in the characters, not so much in this entry"
93645,Mufasa and Timon and Pumba are the only reasons I‚Äôd ever watch this movie again. All the other actors performances were barely middle school drama club worthy. John Oliver never even went into character. 
93646,Awesome music and experience. Seeing the movie on the big screen is a must. The live  animal actors provide a realistic experience to a known story. I highly recommend seeing The Lion King.
93647,The movie lacks the emotion and magic that the original transmitted
93648,loved it... just because  my kids grow up on that movie and I love the songs and everything  about the animation.
93649,They did the original movie justice. Loved it!
93650,It really just wasn‚Äôt great overall. I was impressed by the visuals though. I think what really made it ‚Äúnot great‚Äù was the lack of emotions portrayed in this movie .
93651,"Although the visuals were gorgeous, everything else fell flat. I went in expecting two things:

It would attempt to be just like the original, and then some, perhaps even succeeding.

Or it would attempt to divert tones slightly and kind of do it's own thing.

It was neither. Although it was practically the original, verbatim, it was way less theatrical, and the most emotional or funny parts in the original fell completely flat and monotone in the new one.

The graphics definitely make it worth watching at least."
93652,"Graphics were awesome, but songs we changed and were better in the original."
93653,"loved the beauty of the scenes, loved the singing and the music was awesome!"
93654,Just enough of the old and even some new!
93655,They should of used the same people as they did in the original movie for timon and pumbaa
93656,"It was such an emotionally distant experience I needed a telescope to feel anything.    The animators managed to miss every possibly body langue side of acting.   When Mufassa is going to lecture Simba you just see the cub standing there instead of dropping his ears and crouching down when his father looks at him. 

This is the equivalent of one of those horrible Disney teen cover songs of a classic all done autotune and empty. "
93657,"I agree that emotions were harder to convey in this version than the animated. Some of the magic was lost and nothing new was added to compensate for it. After Aladdin, it‚Äôs a little disappointing. Still a good watch though."
93658,Very good.My kids enjoyed
93659,Absolutely magnificent!!!!
93660,not god. Nalla's voice was bland.. no range
93661,loved lion king as animated movie'..loved this one even more thank you jon favreau and all characters. This movie has  a deep connection to my younger son that unfortunately im estranged with due to his gf now wife
93662,As life like you can get.  Award winning scenes.
93663,"It looked very real to life and well made in all respects. Some parts were a bit long and made it slightly boring, but if I remember correctly the animated version was the same."
93664,"It could've been better, but I liked it"
93665,I watched the animated movie many times growing up and it remains one of my favorites. I was not disappointed with this film. Everything was awesome and I 100% plan to see several more times in theaters.
93666,"This movie was amazing. The visuals were stunning and seeing everything look so real made it even more emotional for me. There are things that are slightly different, but of course it will be. Nicely done Disney!"
93667,They left out most of the good parts in the original movie...but overall it was ok
93668,I thought it was awesome. Both versions are good that I could not decide which one is better.
93669,Acting was subpar none of the lead characters wowed me.  The secondary characters were great pumba timom the two hyenas were good kept the humor going.  visually stunning throughout.   James. Earl Jones was great.
93670,"Loved it and so did my kids, both young and older. They said it was soooo good!!"
93671,I seen it twice and loved it!
93672,The original was much better. Could have done without the bathroom humor suggested but cut from the original and the fat-shaming which added nothing of value. 
93673,I did not like the Beyonce singing but everything else was great
93674,DONALD GLOVER ERMAHGERD!!!!
93675,Movie was great! It brought you right into the jungle with the animals! Loved it!
93676,the movie beautiful from beginning to ending the kids loved it
93677,Photo-realistic. Seth Rogan
93678,"I have seen the animated version, the Broadway version but the big screen live movie was by far the best‚Äî loved it , will go again and will buy the movie when it comes out!"
93679,"An amazing classic redone with todays technology, I loved everything about the movie."
93680,"The movie was exceptional!! The best Disney remake to date. Brought me laughs and tears all while paying the utmost respect to the original. This movie give me a hope for more live action remakes by Disney. This movie proves that you shouldn't always trust what the critical say. If you liked the original, then you will fall in love with this"
93681,Very good!! Timon and Pumba absolutely makes it! Did 4 stars only because you can‚Äôt beat the original!
93682,Excellent! Visually breathtaking!!!
93683,"Amazing graphics, stuck to the original story line wonderfully! Had me amazed within seconds! Lots of laughs and tears. It was fun to take my son to see my favorite movie as a kid and relive the experience all over again. Highly recommend this movie!!"
93684,Monkey wasn‚Äôt funny as the cartoon version and the new song did not fit on the scene Simba was going back home
93685,I Love The Lion ü¶Å King üëë
93686,Loved the effects and cinematography! The music was the best!!
93687,it was amazing! really close to the original and looked so realistic! better win awards!
93688,"I had high expectations for this movie after Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, but this movie fell short. The graphics are the best part, but the songs did not have the impact of the original. The songs didn‚Äôt want me to get up and dance or make me feel the love. The small line changes to try and be different then the original were poorly done. I wanted to love this movie, but the more I think about it the less I like it."
93689,"The voice acting was just terrible, Timon and pumba are my favorite characters and they chose the most annoying voice actor for Timon and pumba was close behind. The singing with scar was awful and then some of the more exciting scenes were lacking luster. didn‚Äôt compare at all to the original. I only gave it two stars because the CGI made it beautiful. Even in a year or two when it‚Äôs on TV I won‚Äôt waste my time and watch it."
93690,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it was a great movie, and there‚Äôs no way the bad part of this movie can take away from the breathtaking scenery and incredible story. However, the voiceovers for the grownup Nala and Simba, were not very good. Beyonc√© should stick to music because her slow pace didn‚Äôt fit the theme of the lion king. Donald Glover made some lines extremely cringeworthy, and it didn‚Äôt sound the way Matthew Broderick made it sound all those years ago. The portrayal of scar was much more intense, vicious, and really embodies what a true villain should be, which made the movie much more enjoyable. Pumba and Timon were hilarious, and provided great comedic support to the movie‚Äôs dramatic and tragic theme. Overall, it‚Äôs a reboot worth seeing for fans of the original and newcomers to the lion king, but by no means is Jon Favreau‚Äôs version of the original Award-Worthy."
93691,It was JUST like the cartoon...almost verbatim. The CGI was amazing however. If you like the cartoon you'll like this one.
93692,Absolutely loved the remake.‚Äù
93693,I loved the movie it was very good!
93694,I understand there were going to be few changes however I just didnt like the fact that the characters were not in sync with the story no type of emotional attachment to the characters and lot of memorial moments were missing.
93695,The original was better. There were a few changes in the new one that were refreshing.
93696,Excellent graphics and sound.  Well with taking the time to see it
93697,Disney is singlehandedly destroying the legacy of their best known classics with these flaccid live action reboots. This movie is like a paint by number lesson in corporate-safe filmmaking. Disney Greed will kill the Golden Goose. 
93698,Wonderful Message for these turbulent times!!! ü•∞
93699,such a beautiful remake of a  classic
93700,A must see! Perfectly done!
93701,Just not as good as the original...
93702,"Nothing to really complain about in this movie. Visually stunning, voice acting was almost perfect. It is as I expected. If you want to renew your childhood, this is the perfect movie "
93703,I liked it but I missed some of the songs from the original. I did like the upgrade on ‚ÄúBe Prepared‚Äù.
93704,Wasn't the best but very enjoyable.
93705,"It was good , but computer animation did not connect with me. My kids liked it"
93706,4 stars because they ruined scars song
93707,"Amazing vizual effects!
However, the lack of emotion shown by the animals made the film feel flat which didn't allow you to feel the film on an emotional level. Going for perfect realism did not pay off in the end unfortunately."
93708,not as good as original.
93709,The hyenas weren‚Äôt funny.  Miss Whoopi!
93710,I liked it when they were younger better and the original is always best but the real version came close. Lion king 2019 did not disappoint the picture quality was outstanding very realistic on the characters and their mouth
93711,The pictures were great
93712,Singing is amazing. Same story line
93713,Lion King 2.0 and it works. Nostalgic and fresh at the same time.
93714,It was phenomenal! The scenery and animals were breathtaking! A great remake I felt like I was right there in Africa with them! Extraordinary recommend to young and old and inbetween its good for anyone!
93715,I like how the storyline was more realistic. More information was given. but I still like the original a little better
93716,"Amazing visuals and a few new laughs but overall felt rushed, animated version is still the best by far!"
93717,"This film is amazing, I am not a great fan of Disney and I don't often watch many movies by them, with the exception of Marvel, but Lion King was my favourite when I was younger and this film did not disappoint. Sticking true to the original material from the 1994 version. Changing only the voice actors and of course changing it to live action.
The voice actors didn't disappoint either with a star power like no other with household names like Donald Glover and Beyonc√© getting on board playing the main characters Simba and Nala. As well as comedic excellence from Seth Rogan who portrays Pumbaa and Keegan Michael-key who plays the joke cracking hyena. They all add a little flare to the characters and can easily be recognised from one another. 
The live action element also added a heightened level of realism, something animated movies especially Disney lack in. All the animals lion, hyena, warthog and so on were fully realistic allowing the audience to escape from the real world more than they would in a less realistic animated film from the 90s. It not only shows how far the film industry and CGI has come but also the great extensive budget that would have been needed to pull off such an amazing full CGI film. 
As I previously stated the film was amazing at keeping to the original source material, but in a way it was made even better by the heightened realism and improved voice acting. The death scenes were even more tear-jerking in Mufasa's case and even more breath-taking in Scar's case, and most of all the songs were made even better by having talented singers like Beyonc√© and Donald Glover leading the pack.
Overall, Lion King is a breath-taking film, galvanizing the already amazing original into modern times. Encompassing both star power and heightened realism. Definitely a must watch. 
"
93718,stayed very close to the original movie with some modern technology
93719,"Went to see before taking my 8, 6, and 3 year old grandchildren.  Loved the scenery and the love of family side of the film.  DID NOT think the brutal death scene and the scary animals were appropriate (nor necessary) for a childrens movie! Will not be taking my grandchildren."
93720,My great grandson was so excited watching it.
93721,I enjoyed the whole movie it was what I expected and more.
93722,I‚Äôll give it a half cause of the comedy .... but horrible don‚Äôt take away scenes or lines from the original .. okay to add but don‚Äôt take away and the overall connection wasn‚Äôt there seemed off also the hyenas were off from what it should be and just to stupid... but at least we still have the original... by the way to you Beyonc√© fans she should never do voice overs .....
93723,"So wonderful! Cried 4 times, I‚Äôll leave it to you to figure out when...."
93724,Loved the movie. It brought me memories from childhood. My family enjoyed it as well. A classic is always a hit!!!
93725,I loved it! Fantastic job recreating a classic with some perfect amendments.
93726,A more boring version of the original. The animals looked too real for their mouths to move and y‚Äôall like humans. Disney‚Äôs worst remake yet. 
93727,Really enjoyed the reboot
93728,The music wasn't dynamic enough. The Boomp at the logo flash could have been penetrating--but was dialed back. The last note of the film was two beats too short to reach its full psychological impact. And the new music added nothing. What was with all that Mozart/Requiem-esque underscoring? Oh well. Missed the Spike Jones hula song!
93729,"First off this is a good stand-alone movie, if you've never seen the original. 

If you are a die hard fan of the original, you won't like this movie. There are too many additions, and take aways to make this better than the original. 
Visually the movie looks great but the visuals were not enough to hold me into liking it over the original. 

If you gonna into this as a comparison to the original you will be disappointed."
93730,"EPIC, LOVED IT GREAT REMAKE."
93731,"It just was really lacking all the magic that came with the original.  Music scores play to the film, and this live action on some songs just didn't sound right on some scenes. In a day where technology is so advanced and the option to bring an amazing original classic alive is there, but it didn't need to be done. I would have been ready to watch a re-release in theaters. For those of you who love Lion King the original,  I personally think you can wait to watch this on Netflix"
93732,Voice actors had no emotion it was just stale and generally boring
93733,"Seth Rogan is laugh-out-loud funny. The critics, however, are tired and boring."
93734,Excellent adaptation!
93735,Solid production! Great cast! Videography was amazing! Must see! 
93736,"Definitely not as good as the original and I recommend parents share that one with their children and let them decide.  I enjoyed hearing some of the songs again and new actors' take on the characters, but there was nothing amazing or outstanding about this version of Disney's greatest animated movie."
93737,I think the only thing I liked about the lion king...was the ending fights. I mean who doesn't like to see some national geographic type of shit go down??? I overall felt a little silly watching this film though.
93738,So great!! This is our second time watching it since we were kids and it gave us that same warm and fuzzy feeling!!
93739,Took me back to my childhood and just made me smile throughout. Ignore the critics!
93740,"A beautiful, must see."
93741,Absolutely loved it!!!
93742,"John Favreau did an amazing job directing this film. It was reminiscent of the original animated feature. However, watching it come to life with life-like characters was absolutely spectacular! It‚Äôs a must see right now!"
93743,"Eh.... Thought it was boring and mediocre.  The animated version is better IMO.  Save your money, wait for it to hit HBO"
93744,It doesn‚Äôt hold up to the original.
93745,I liked it well enough to recommend it.  I took my grandkids and they seemed to like it.
93746,Love it!  Beautiful scenery and it was a great experience.
93747,"Excellent cinematography and a great cast. Yes, it‚Äôs a remake and the plot was predictable. However, I enjoyed watching this movie, and sharing an updated moment from my childhood to my daughter."
93748,it was pretty boring to me
93749,Absolutely Amazing!!!
93750,Loved it. I'm a huge Lion King Fan owing the original and have seen the play twice on Broadway and I loved it. I love that they kept to the original and so happy they were able to cast James Earl Jones because let's face it no one can replace him. I thought it was filled with emotion as I did tear up a few times. Its not to replace the original more to enhance it.
93751,"The new Lion King is a shadow of the original. It suffers from transition issues and pacing issues  with dialog as well as expression.  This creates a lot of somewhat awkward line delivery and jumps.

The animation is overall good, but feels really motion tweened. This create a lot of smooth motion but not everything should be smoothed and calculated. Sharp movements are dramatic, and where almost completely lacking."
93752,Loved the live animation! Perfect!!!
93753,Loved it!!! Opening was almost identical to the original- I‚Äôm very happy about that. Overall followed the same with little changes here and there to adapt to modern time.
93754,"I was not disappointed. I am not a fan of remakes; however, I made an exception to watch it. I feel like it stuck to the original story better than any remakes. Great job Disney!"
93755,Great movie!! Brought back child hood memories!!
93756,This movie was worth 24 years to see. Now this is a remake! One to buy for the collection! They did a phenomenal job!!
93757,"A more mature and fresh version of the Disney classique. Visually astonishing that at times reminded me of a David Attenborough documentary. I absolute loved it, especially Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen as Timon and Pumbaa! They were born to play those characters. Special mention to John Oliver's Zazhu who's very under appreciated I think"
93758,loved it!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ôåü¶Å
93759,AMC Hamilton didn‚Äôt showcase the movie in 3D. The AC was not working. They put on the normal mode of the movie and then announced that there is no 3D version. We were asked to collect passes at the end of the movie. We walked out and got a refund. Poor planning by the theater and waste of time for me and family.
93760,Nothing short of greatness. I loved that it stuck to the original story line. The characters were so realistic it brought back feelings of when I was a kid and thought the characters were real. The only bad thing I would ever say about this remake is that Pumbaa and Timones song to the hyenas was cut out.
93761,I loved how they didn‚Äôt stray from the original that much because if it‚Äôs not broken don‚Äôt fix it
93762,I enjoyed how close to the story the movie was.
93763,"Good movie just did not add much to the story, the animated version is my favorite animated movie."
93764,I love it. My son with Autism kept a smile on his face through the whole movie
93765,Wasnt like the original movie.
93766,always will be a great movie but didnt have the wow factor from when I was a kid. Definitely enjoyed it
93767,"Awesome movie 
Love begging to end"
93768,"I loved the animation, the score, and the message. It was very entertaining.  Great job!"
93769,I disliked that it made me cry
93770,All around fantastic!
93771,"It was great. I loved the movie, the music and the life messaging"
93772,A 90‚Äôs classic done correctly !!!!
93773,"Pleasure watching it, wpuld recommend to friends & families."
93774,"Back in 1994, Disney released an animated movie titled ‚ÄòThe Lion King‚Äô. It became an instant classic and hugely successful during awards season. It launched plays around the world. It also revolutionized musical scores thank to Hans Zimmer, my favorite film composer of all time. Jon Favreau directed ‚Äòthe Jungle Book‚Äô remake back in 2016. When Disney announced a ‚ÄòThe Lion King‚Äô remake in development, I felt super nervous about... until they hired Jon Favreau to direct it. I got excited and I made #3 of my most anticipated movies of 2019. The movie came out, I went and saw it in 3D - and I thought it was... OKAY. When the movie faded in to the horizon before the sunset, I smiled instantly because I knew I dug the movie already. The Circle of Life was BEAUTIFUL in live-action. I almost teared up. The rest of the movie, not so different from the original. There are a couple new things in the movie that caught my eye - things that were different from the original. But everything else... it‚Äôs a shot-for-shot remake. The vocal performances were outstanding (particularly James Earl Jones, Donald Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor, John Kani, Seth Rogen, and Billy Eichner). The visual are JAW DROPPING. But some of the facial motions were kinda bland. It felt like an unnecessary movie to remake. 6.6/10."
93775,"Really? A serious scar? Where is the fucking eddy? Awful movie, I hated! Too serious for a child movie! Sound OK, beautiful grafic, but... "
93776,"The visuals were great and very realistic, but this movie didn‚Äôt do the original justice. Scars musical bit was confusing you didn‚Äôt know if it was about to start or if that was it, turns out that was it. Timon and Pumba were my favorite just wished they would have incorporated more of the original like the if you‚Äôre aching for some bacon song. Knowing Beyonc√© was playing adult Nala definitely influenced what you think of her altogether in negative way. Hiring someone who‚Äôs voice is a little known prob would babe been better. Rafiki was one of my favorites in the original but in this version he might as well have not been in it. You could do with waiting for this to come out on TV or online vs in theater and just watch it on the couch."
93777,"I saw this movie about 10 years ago, and I thought it was pretty good. I gave it a 4/5 back then. But, since the first time I watched The Lion King, they did this digital remaster.
I was going to rate this digital remaster a 4/5, just like I rated the original. Sadly, I think whoever they hired to retouch the original film's animation must have been drunk. The characters don't have facial expressions anymore. Also, some audio tweeks seem to have made some of the line reads less emotive as well.
In summary, this digital remaster is exactly the same as the original except it looks bad. If you're thinking of seeing the Lion King in theatres this weekend, don't bother. It's already available in its original form on dvd and for streaming online, and for a much better price."
93778,"What was Disney thinking when they cast the voice for Simba?  ""Childish Gambini"" uses some of the worst language, racial slurs and sexual innuendo today and Disney chose him as the voice of one of the most timeless characters of all time!!!  If anyone wants to see what they don't want their children to act like look up ""Childish Gambini"" on You Tube.  Poor casting choice and absolutely shameful.  They did a mediocre job with Timone, Pumba and Rafiki, robbing them of the humor of their characters and some classic scenes such as the Hula bait scene. Beyonc√©'s role as Nala overpowered Simba and she sang way too many songs which took away from the story line. The voice of James Earl Jones was the only saving grace was this otherwise waste of two hours and fifty dollars. "
93779,Awesome movie like 1st one!!!
93780,absolutley loved it.  the visuals and details in the animals to the scenery were stunning. some differences from the cartoon but this only added to the storyline.
93781,It was very beautiful and right to the first movie. Took my granddaughter and we really enjoyed it.
93782,Great remake of a classic!
93783,I love it a very good movie
93784,Our time's timeless classic revived and amazing!
93785,"Not like the original at all! Missing key elements and heart in the original characters, and so many signature songs were revised or missing. Movie was so dark. Disney stick to the original script! Your fans don't come to see a ""remake"" they come to see their beloved childhood movie come to life.  "
93786,"A copy, paste of a better film. The 2019 remake felt like it has no soul, no emotion, and no imagination."
93787,Characters have no charisma. The only one who held up to the original was the bird Zazou. Pumba was also pretty good. All others were very flat. Beyonc√© was terrible. No spirit in her delivery. Very disappointed.
93788,Lion King was okay. Basically scene by scene the same as the animated movie with some differences and additions. Timone and Pumba were the only comedic breath of fresh air in this bland take. Save yourself the cost of a ticket due to the hype and just rent or buy the animated film.
93789,"Way more emotional heft (which I never thought possible) with the realistic animals. Music numbers are the highlight, but you lose a bit of connection with the dialogue with the more authentic animal faces which, obviously, shouldn't be speaking. "
93790,I loved everything about this movie!! It makes me want to watch it again
93791,"I loved the animation.  It looked very realistic.   But I think the reason I loved it so much, is that my husband and I saw it with our adult children and it was awesome to rewatch it with them since they grew up on it.  I loved Pumba and Timon!!"
93792,"This movie is exactly what it says on the tin. It is a live ""looking"" film that projects what the lion king is. It's still as good as ever with a bit of everything put in the mix. The scenery is flawless but a bit blurry at times, the animals look as real as they can get, although this does take away from the comedy side as making a face that fits the tone or  changing the colour in the cant wait to be king song would take away all the realism that this movie tries to provide. Don't get me wrong there is a lot of new laughs to be had in its place. I am glad they made this movie and am pleased to of watched it. will it beat my childhood love for Disney ... No, but giving credit it has made me want to watch the old one again."
93793,"like watching the original all over again, but real life."
93794,"If you like the original, you will love this. Critics have it wrong, sorry... the fact that they DO follow the original script for the most part is why I love it so much. "
93795,Seeing it with my son's.
93796,"""Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."" Dr. Ian Malcolm"
93797,Awesome! Never heard of a Southern lion but it was a great movie.
93798,No facial expressions that show emotion... very bland and kinda boring
93799,it was a cool little movie.
93800,You would like it if you like to see nature
93801,Really Loved the movie! I highly recommend seeing it!  üòÄ
93802,Actual story was great. The songs were not.
93803,My son and I loved it!!
93804,Original was better.
93805,"I loved every part of the movie , it was absolutely outstanding and is a must see especially for all the 90‚Äôs kids"
93806,I enjoyed watching the original with my sons and this live action remake is excellent as well! üëçüèæüëçüèæ
93807,Great remake of one of my all time favorites!
93808,"Amazing effects, true to story"
93809,it was a good movie! i really enjoyed it.
93810,love LOVED it! i saw the original as a kid in the theater and i cried.  i cried this time too and i never cry in movies.  well done!
93811,Over all the kids liked everything about it
93812,"It‚Äôs not a great movie to take an autistic toddler too. The CGI was amazing, the scenery was spectacular. It was the same exact story though. Almost verbatim. Had the story changed a little, it would have been more compelling story for a toddler to pay attention too. Overall it was still good."
93813,Great movie! Real world graphics were amazing
93814,"Awesome! Go see it yourself, don't listen to the critics or the tomatoes.  Some tomato throwers may have not liked how the laws of this jungle hit home. "
93815,"It was amazing, I loved it and still loving it. Thanks"
93816,"I really enjoyed! It took a moment to get used to the ""realness"" of the movie, but ocer all it was great!. My son and I enjoyed the songs and added funny moments."
93817,"To put it simply, I loved it. It was everything my inner child hoped it would be, while maintaining a sense of realism in the animals that my adult self could be on board with. Would highly recommend to all audiences."
93818,Love the 3D effects.
93819,Great for the whole family!  Even Grandma!!!
93820,"Great movie, funny, well filmed, good story, just beautiful to watch!!"
93821,The movie was beautiful to look at but there were liberties taken with the story that I'm pretty sure anyone over 30 years old doesn't appreciate
93822,Its a perfect remake!! I loved it!! 
93823,"It‚Äôs the EXACT same movie, shot for shot, word for word. 0 creativity to make it their own. "
93824,Beautifully put together! True to the original story with a few new twists.
93825,Great job on the movie. Liked that James Earl Jones was the voice of Mufasa again.
93826,Did not met my expectations.
93827,"It was fantastic. If you thought it was going to be frame by frame, phrase by phrase the same as the original, then you're a fool."
93828,Awesome movie! My kids enjoyed it!
93829,Good visuals. Too realistic actions. Barely any personality.
93830,Nothing beats an original but it was a great remake. I love the real animals.
93831,Stayed true to the original animated version.
93832,"NO EMOTION at all. Timon and Pumba were the only reason I loved about the movie.  Every other character spoke with absolutely no emotion except for Beyonce. Was surprise how much I liked her in the movie was a little worried because her voice is so distinctive but she was perfect for the voice. Simba spoke so monotone, I couldn't stand it. The movie itself felt so rushed and way to intense, there was no comedy. HUGE disappointment."
93833,The cartoon was WAY better. They should have kept some original catch phrases.
93834,I must admit to being a massive Disney fan as well as a huge fan of musicals. I am a particular fan of the lion king and have seen the theatre production in London and New York. Also visited Disneyland in Paris and Japan. Unfortunately this was a disappointment to me and I don't ever say that about Disney movies! The film was stripped of the comedy which made it a very serious film more about the action scenes and graphics than fun and music. The story element was there and it told a great story but it didn't bring me any joy or laughter... timone and pumba in particular are characters that should have been hilarious but... wow.. yawnsville. The funny bits were just cut out...Why Disney!? Why!!
93835,Not as good as Original graphics were nice but no mufasa cloud is a nono
93836,"love it, completely!!"
93837,secondary product not needed
93838,Its a must see. Not for young kids. Very powerful movie about how life can take away make you sad and give you happiness in the end of hard times.
93839,Loved it!  Would definitely see it again. Can‚Äôt wait till it comes out on DVD. I‚Äôm buying it.
93840,"Aside from the fact that it's visually one of the best movies I've seen, it sucked. They took out some songs and shortened other ones. They changed too much dialog for this to be considered the Lion King."
93841,"The music, animation and vocals were all excellent!"
93842,"Awesome film - one of the humour wasn't as spot on as in the first one, but otherwise it was pretty cool to relive that movie in this new (and impressively beautiful) format."
93843,Wonderful! I don't know what the critics were thinking!
93844,It was a very entertaining movie. It kept you engaged from beginning to end!! And the live action was phenomenal!! Loved The Lion King!!!!!
93845,Was brilliantly done!! Wow. I think the singing could have been way better. But overall was brillaint.
93846,"this movie beautiful
"
93847,This movie was incredible and the critics are insane for saying it wasn't good. If you grew up watching the original Disney Animated version you will love it.
93848,If I had never seen the first one then I would give it 4 starts but because I have then it‚Äôs a 3.5
93849,No expression! The original cartoon version is best!
93850,Outstanding visuals but almost too realistic. When the animals spoke it was jarring. The original is still the best. The ultra realism was great to look at but it lost some of the artistry. Disney-please stop. The classics are good. Please leave them alone now.
93851,"The movie did a great job retelling a classic story. The new graphics were done well. The selection of voices were choosen well also. Overall, it was a nice balance of the old and the new aspects of such a great movie. Job well done."
93852,"I rarely rate movies. This one, I had to. I cried maybe 20 times throughout the movie. The CGI was amazing and so realistic. Down the veins and muscles, the lions were presented in their majestic nature. My favorite Disney remake by far, without contest. Seriously, so beautiful. I'm going to watch it again in IMAX."
93853,"I love the story and the actors but the voice inflection and emotion wasn't complimented by the animation as much as you'd like. Granted they are animals, the emotion was portrayed in the original much more convincingly than this live action version"
93854,Loved it better than the original
93855,"Definitivamente espere mas de este remake, la pelicula animada la supera por mucho, la falla de esta pelicula es que se siente muy floja cada escena, nada que ver con el libro de la selva"
93856,Disappointed at the new dialogue and songs. Should‚Äôve stick to the original. 
93857,All around great service
93858,In tears....it was phenomenal ‚ù§
93859,The production was amazing.
93860,The movie was great! Emotional roller coaster. Loved it
93861,The Lion King is an OK movie. It‚Äôs no where near the original.
93862,better than the original.
93863,My children loved I loved it brought me back to my childhood its a must see
93864,Excellent animation! Well done!
93865,Must see! Best disney remake so far! I would definitely watch again!
93866,Love the special effects and the music great movie
93867,"I thought it was awesome, same story but technology has made it prettier"
93868,I liked the entire movie
93869,I liked the scenery and the music.
93870,This movie was not at all what i was expecting. The CGI was almost cheap and commercial like. The voice acting with most of the characters was terrible (including Beyonc√©). The best scene is the fighting scene at the end of the movie. This just wasn't a good remake at all. The scene transitions were tacky and cringeworthy. D
93871,"It wasnt what i was expecting,  but it does make me appreciate the animated much more. (The Original)"
93872,"Not as good as the original. The live action Jungle Book was better. Wait for DVD or digital download, not worth spending the money going to the movies."
93873,Very well done. I only cried twice. I grew up with this movie!! Very nostalgic!
93874,loved the action and the music
93875,The movie was awesome! The music was even greater! One of best Disney movie of all times!
93876,The original had MUCH more humor. I realize some of the visual humor can‚Äôt be duplicated with ‚Äúlive action‚Äù but the new actors didn‚Äôt have the same personal relationships in real life as the original actors and it came across in the remake.
93877,"Great! Young Simba was sangin! Adult Simba was sangin too!!! James Earl Jones at 88, I am just amazed! Still great! The graphics were WONDERFUL! It looked so real! I love the original story line but also love the freshness of the added details! Timon and Pumba...still stars! Beyonc√© you were singing gal! My family thoroughly enjoyed this film! I love the original and I love this one too! Kudos! "
93878,I loved it make a #2 please!!!!!
93879,Loved everything about this movie!
93880,"The realistic look to all the animals was amazing, every detail seemed legit not just the main characters... Great soundtrack as well!!!"
93881,"Not as good as the original. An remake gone array, a classic that should never have been touched"
93882,I like that it was in 3D the animation was excellent
93883,I love the shot for shot scenes from the original. I prefer the old flamboyant sassy Scar over the new sort of depressed Scar. Why not the Luau song instead of the Be My Guest rip off?
93884,Loved it. Just as good as the original
93885,"Nothing new, definitely didnt need a director as it was just a straight forward copy. Some poor cgi and laziness with speeding up or slowing down thungs that could have been great in real time. Also wish theyd have told Beyonce to just sing the song and not try too run the duet. "
93886,They should've kept the original script. 
93887,Don‚Äôt compare it to the original.
93888,best 2 hours of my life
93889,Glad James earl jones got to reprised his role as Mufasa 
93890,"It was a good way to see it updsted with the animals. It's just like the one I saw when I was younger. I did not go because of the celebrity status, I went to see how the action option would be displayed to the audience"
93891,Stunning visuals! Looks super realistic & amazing! I loved it & will definitely watch it again.
93892,"I was so disappointed with the film. I went it with high expectations of how my heart strings were going to be pulled, I felt it would happen as I watched one of my childhood favorites come to life. However, this film did the very opposite. It was emotionless and left me feeling as if I were watching a National Geographic doc."
93893,"The visuals were stunning.  The movie is a true technical achievement on that front.  As with Jungle Book, this version of the story is missing a lot of the heart that the original had.  It is also suffering from a pretty bad uncanny valley affect with some of the talking animals.  It was difficult to really get immersed in the story apart from a few very select sequences."
93894,"Lack luster movie, has no soul and NO Disney Magic. Scar who is one of my favorite villians was terrible. The saving grace was James Earl Jones being Mufasa. "
93895,"The 3D was so well done. The movements of the animals matched, the symbolism was done well. I loved all of it. Wish the theater had the music louder for more dramatic effect, but enjoyed every minute."
93896,"The CGI was awesome, however I liked the original better. MPAA rating needs to be evaluated. It was a little too violent for the younger audience. I heads kids screaming and fighting. Even my 6 y.o. grandson cringed and jumped."
93897,It was very good! A lot of the movie was frame bu frame the hand drawn version. My only complaint and it's because I'm biased to jermey irons. Is scar seemed to lack just a bit. But other than that amazing job! Saw it twice
93898,It was almost 100 like the original one which is nice because I didn‚Äôt want it Disney to ruin the nostalgia
93899,Who cares about what the critics say. It was so emotional and I absolutely loved the movie. There were some things added. The singing was just phenomenal!
93900,The hyenas were not animated/funny like the original. They took out the hula dance which was a huge disappointment for me. Beyonc√© singing was fantastic...her voiceover was expressionless and just didn‚Äôt do it for me. The CGI was fantastic.
93901,"Nothing new. It's the Lion King, but with the soul sucked out of it. It has dull line delivery with expressionless animals. Timon and Pumba have some funny moments and I liked Zazu, but those are the only positive things I can say."
93902,Great movie. Missed the dance for Timon and pumbaa to the hyenas but everything's was amazing.
93903,loved it!! couldn't have been better!!
93904,Absolutely amazing movie
93905,Loved the realness of the movie
93906,The musical and original were better.
93907,I‚Äôve seen the lion king original since I was a kid and always loved it I‚Äôm 26 now and it felt like I was a kid all over again stuck really close to what it originally was
93908,Exactly followed the script of the original animated movie...wouldve like to see a little new stuff
93909,"I absolutely loved the added touch the life-like animals gave to expressing the emotion of the movie. As always, the soundtrack was breathtaking, although I was a bit disappointed that ‚ÄúHe Lives In You‚Äù was removed from the movie. Still one of my favourite movies of all time, and will watch again and again."
93910,Visuals were great but no real emotion in the characters. Definitely was expecting more from the cast n the movie overall.
93911,"It was good - only the epic, incredible movies should get the 5 stars."
93912,I loved all aspects of this movie!
93913,"I think it was so well done, don't complain about facial expressions, it's not the animated version, they tried to make it as real as posible... "
93914,brought me back to my childhood a few changes in the movie but still amazing
93915,"Good solid movie. However,  some of the songs could of been stronger and so could of could l Scar. Movie moved at correct pace and was very interesting. Love how it paid tribute to the original."
93916,"This film was soulless. I feels like what it was, a cash grab exploiting nostalgia for the original. The original film has heart, this thing most certainly doesn't."
93917,The original cartoon movie was far superior to the CGI rendition. The new movie seemed to drag and was not as engaging as its predecessor.
93918,"I don't think comparing it to the original is fair because reality and cartoons just will not ever be equal. For some children the fight scenes may appear too realistic and the comedy of Cheech and Whoopi were missed. Otherwise, it was and still is an excellent story and movie. "
93919,"True to the original with a few bothersome moments, but nothing that ruins the movie."
93920,"Dynamic! Everything was awesome! The songs, the voices, the magnificent display of the animals. I loved every minute of this movie. Of course it will never be the original and due to the animals being realistic it took away some of the emotions but the actor real helped you to connect and have the same feelings you felt as a kid. Great experience!"
93921,The screen was kind of blurry
93922,Beyonce and childish gambino should never voice over another animated character again in their careers. 
93923,Great movie. Don't trust the critics. A must see. 
93924,We ended up leaving early because there was absolutely no emotion showed by any of the characters. Big disgrace to the original.
93925,Loved this in 3D. The movie stayed close to the animated version with a few small changes.  I would recommend this movie for anyone!
93926,"Visuals were absolutely breathtaking! unfortunately I didn't think the voice actors gave enough emphasis or inflection on their lines. Also there was a lot of filler lines, over explaining things that simply weren't necessary. Worth watching for the visuals and Timon and Pumbaa were great."
93927,The nostalgia was real! It took me back. I thought this was a great live action take on a Disney classic. Amazing family film 3
93928,Wonderful realistic recreation of the cartoon. Beautiful cinematic and hit all the right notes for nostalgia for the Lion King. If only the animals could show a bit more emotions. But it didn‚Äôt ruin the magic and majestic of the movie.
93929,"It was funny! I really enjoyed it. I wasn't sure if it was going to be better than the original, but it totally was. It was my son's 19th Birthday... He was the one who wanted to see it. I admit I drug my feet at first. But It was completely worth it. I would see it again!"
93930,"Loved it! Gorgeous cinematography, excellent remake. Critics are full of crap. Go see it."
93931,13 yr old review. Its really good! I really like the real animals rather than cartoon animation
93932,I like how on this one they did the fill in the blanks. Like how Nala left Pride Rock Define Simba unlike the cartoon it just showed her showing up hunting Pumba
93933,"Not as great as the '94 original but I wasn't expecting it to 'rule' over it, in all honesty. Nothing really can compare to the original or ever be better, in my opinion, not even the Broadway version. I felt this movie met and even exceeded all my expectations. Jon Favreau couldn't have made a better photo-realistic animated version. This movie's graphics were phenomenal, I cried and laughed at the same scenes, the music was just as haunting and touching as I remembered, and I loved the new scenes and dialogue. This movie is definitely not an exact duplicate of the original, trust me! There are so many new takes on songs, scenes, jokes, etc. Though the storyline follows the '94 version closely it is still its own film, and to judge it based on its predecessor's existence is a mistake. Audiences and critics need to view this movie as its own entity.  Just a well-made, not scene-for-scene (contrary to popular belief, but close), beautiful and masterful take on the beloved classic! Go see this, now!"
93934," Overall loved the movie, the only downside was the lack of emotion in some of the scenes. They couldn‚Äôt replicate the classic facial expressions from the original with the CGI. Besides that I enjoyed every minute of it. The bad reviews are from the typical trolls who purposely try to cause division since they have nothing better to do in life. "
93935,"It‚Äôs the same movie with two extra scenes, staged with pantomiming CGI animals not as well as the 1994 version. If you‚Äôve never and won‚Äôt see the original, you might be okay with this. I found it a slog. M"
93936,Awesome movie. Brought back many good memories
93937,The graphics and sound were great.
93938,THIS MOVIE IS TRASH TRASH TRASH!!! NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL.
93939,"loved it, took me back!"
93940,it's was ok. I felt more entertained with the Animated feature the characters had more personalities.
93941,"The movie was overall good. I thought the special effects and quality of the movie was pretty good. However, some parts of the movie were not as dramatic as the original 1994 version. I thought the actors could have been selected a little better to fit the part of each character."
93942,I didn‚Äôt go. I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to get a refund.
93943,100% amazing in every way. 
93944,The nostalgia and subtle changes to help the young and old love the movie
93945,I enjoyed the whole movie that wasn't nothing I didn't like it was excellent excellent movie
93946,üíóüíñLoved it! Outstanding detail! Could not tell it was CGI! Jon Favreau is the man!!!
93947,"Worse than the Disney additions to the Star Wars universe. At least the new movies pretended to be something new and original.
Favreau's take on The Lion King, however, is an almost complete shot-for-shot remake of the original. Very few changes in the writing have been made. Rather than making us a brand new cake, Favreau strips the frosting off the old cake, lazily applies a new layer, and tries to sell it as a brand new product."
93948,Loved the movie as much as the original animated filmüíú!
93949,Interesting to see the new interpretation of this classic. I was surprised that it was the same voice actor for Mufasa. It was literally like watching animal planet but all the animals were talking haha
93950,"Just as epic as the original. I left this feeling as though I had seen it for the first time all over again. It is visually stunning, so take advantage and spend the extra few dollars to see it in Dolby or IMAX."
93951,"A timeless classic since I was a child. Brought back so many memories and made some new ones.  I loved how the creators truly captured the animals complexity from real looks to actual actions each animal does in real life, especially the lions. Was phenomenal work. A must see, and own once out on DVD."
93952,"I do love the animation! It is breath-taking! Disney could not have done a better job than this story! The casting is superb and everyone did a 'swell job in voice-overs!

What I don't like is that they made it feel so rush when they get to the second-half of the plotline just to get the story going! They cut down Simba's serious conversation with Rafiki about Mufasa, and replaced it instead with Simba's travelling tuff of fur (showcasing Disney's CGI animation on African wildlife instead with the ants, the giraffe, the beetle). Nala's reunion with Simba (and their conversation on going back to the Pride Lands) is too rush! I'm looking for sensuality between these two, but I did not find it here. When the music ""Can you Feel the Love tonight?"" played in the background, it was broad daylight instead of dusk. Overall, I am saying it is a must-see movie on the summer, but watching it once is enough for me. I actually prefer the 1994 original 'cause it has so much heart in it meaning the animated cartoons showcased their emotions through their animated faces. With the CGI lions, that is so hard to do given their emotions are buried in their furry faces. I'm just giving this one a 3.5 out of 5 stars 'cause the nostalgia somewhat kicked in during the first half of the movie. :)"
93953,Loved the movie!  The animation and the music were wonderful.
93954,A great remake. Still felt the magic. Loved the new humor. 
93955,Lion King was amazing ‚ÄºÔ∏è I really did enjoyed it and what‚Äôs even better? They did each and every part just like the cartoon movies I love it!!
93956,Both my mother and my daughter and I loved  the movie! 3-D is the best way to go!
93957,Magestic adaptation. Voice actors perfectly cast. True to the original with a few fun surprises.
93958,It was ok. Animated version can never be out done.  I could have waited for it to come out on DVD.
93959,"Outstanding visuals yes, but thats about it. It just didn't capture the grand epicness of the original. Seems everything was just turned down. The score and the songs were greatly toned down. The comedy reduced to a few one liners, the expressions, the slapstick, the emotional range (going with realism) was toned down. The melaciousness of Scar, the grandios of Mufasa, the struggle of Simba was all just turned down! Thinking positive, the visuals, some extra scenes, some epanded ideas, yes, good, but they werent properly fleshed out. Some really cool things could have added a lot to the film but it just didn't. Really just makes me appreciate the original better. Maybe I just know it too well, maybe this one was just not what I wanted it to be. "
93960,"When comparing it to the original, I like the original better. This film is basically a SHOT for SHOT remake of the original animated version. Due to the CGI and the expressions of the eyes of the character, the emotional moments, highlights of the original, fall flat. A sad Simba sounds SAD, but doesn't really project it with the facial expressions, so that was the only thing that bothered me and took me out of the impact of certain scenes. Overall, it was good enough, especially to a new generation that has never seen the original. "
93961,Loved the animation it was AMAZING ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
93962,I was just like the original. My heart fluttered. Beyonce was fantastic and great.
93963,Good movie fun to see the animation come to real life
93964,This movie was amazing!!! The cartoon was my first movie in theaters and it was like I was a kid again!!!
93965,It was great. Nothing changed which was even better but the sound quality was a little low
93966,Disliked Beyonce's acting
93967,Good movie... But it was not genuinely as sad as the original. Good movie and breathless visuals.
93968,awesome movie! right on point to the original
93969,A must see beloved classic!
93970,"Flat acting from beyonce and seth rogan ruined this movie, oh and scars song was ruined "
93971,Excellent move for all age groups.
93972,Amazing movie! Great for those of us who grew up with it! My daughter wasn‚Äôt a big fan. She‚Äôs 4 though.
93973,"I know this movie is a remake but geez at least add something new. It was literally the same as the original, line per line as the original. I will only tell my kids about the animated version. What a waste of money."
93974,Best movie when I was a child best movie again
93975,"I wish I could have given this 0 stars. I am a big fan of the original and this took the original, bent it over and raped it over and over with a spiked dildo and lube made from Hydrochloric acid. They made scar a brazen pansy, rushed the plot, the acting was horrible. they screwed up the songs royally and if you were a fan of Be Prepared, it's not there. they pretended to put it in but glossed over it like an aphid at a Klan rally. Yet another movie Disney rushed trying to remake it to make more money. it was so disappointing that in an era where the movies are insanely expensive and money is hard to make, I'd consider this a net loss and I am a Disney shareholder... I am ashamed of Disney and what they did to this movie."
93976,Rotten Tomatoes got their rating way off this time.  This new version is a HIT BIG TIME!
93977,Loved it!!!!! But could of done without Beyonc√©‚Äôs voice other than that IT WAS GREAT MOVIE! I‚Äôd go see it again!
93978,very emotional and awesome animation
93979,Amazzzzzing!!! Go see it
93980,great adaption of the original. kept it familiar without changing the main parts
93981,"It was refreshing and beautiful! I think Mr. Walt Disney would be proud of this production. It was funny, yet soul stirring and the animals were truly a work of art. Action, Adventure, and Dramedy!"
93982,"If you loved The Lion King as a child and have fond memories of the music and the characters of the original, you will love this movie. Yes some things are changed to sell the effect. But the heart, and spirit of the original is there and it still has the same emotional punch that the original had. Make sure to go see it in a loud theater!"
93983,Some of the key scenes lacked the original build up to them. Missed opportunity there.
93984,"That was awful, they really F'ed this up. The voice overs weren't as good. Beyonce as Nala was terrible and allowing her to bring in personal qualities was annoying. The darkness of this movie was frustrating when the original was so good. This was a massive fail. "
93985,I really wished they would have added to the storyline. Give something unexpected.    Nothing to ok exciting except the live animal imagery.
93986,"Although it looks great, it does not have the same feel as the original which was one of the greatest cartoons ever made."
93987,This movie was incredible!! The realness of the animals was astounding! You cannot go wrong with the Lion King
93988,When you make a masterpiece and remake a crappy movie how is that possible Disney.
93989,mostly great. nearly line for line for the original. visual effects were awesome. see it - you'll like it. my littler kids got sort of bored though.
93990,I liked the live animals CNG...
93991,It was exactly the same as the original movie exactly the same.
93992,It is a decent retelling of the classic Disney movie. It seems to add extra dialogue that was not needed for Nala and the change of the hyenas dynamics was not working for me.
93993,the movie was done very well when it comes to animation. The only thing that I have a problem with was the music. I think that they shouldn't have casted big-name celebrities because you had Beyonce overpowering a lot and people like Seth Rogan who can't keep a note. I was very underwhelmed by the music because it felt more like a concert (lots of unnecessary runs) than a musical (lacked a lot of power in the sound).
93994,"Really enjoyed the movie. Had some great laughs. Brought back a lot of memories, but the ladies next to me could not shut up."
93995,"I loved the movie,  It was pretty much like the original cartoon of the Lion King.  The only thing that I missed the original voices of the Laughing Hyenas were not the from the Original movie staring Whoopi Goldberg nor Cheech Marin.  Those two made the part of the hyenas.  Other than that, the movie was a 5 Star."
93996,not worth the money stay home if you dont want the original to be ruined
93997,I really liked it ! I is amazing the work they did with computer animation!
93998,"Great movie. If anyone says different, they‚Äôre nitpicking."
93999,A classic in which revised for both the nostalgic old fans and new audiences
94000,The move was absolutely fantastic!!! We plan to see it again really soon.
94001,"It wasn't better than the original, but it was still good. "
94002,Just an amazing live adaptation from animation. 
94003,The animals have zero facial expressions and that cast sounds like they are just going thought the motions reading a script. 
94004,"Same story. Music was not up to par. Compared to the recent Aladdin remake, Lion King failed to provide that grandiose music that made the movie what it was. Although the voices for the characters was superb. Great choices in voice actors. 
Overall 4 stars music did not live up to expectation."
94005,i absolutely love it!
94006,It was fabulous. The animals looked so real and the music was awesome!
94007,They chose great actors for the voices
94008,"I really hate that the hyenas funny part, Mufasa, oooo day it again! was left out. That is one of the funniest parts of the original and as an adult, I was waiting for that part. The animation is incredible. Almost too real! I fear that our children will have no imagination."
94009,"I loved it! It felt close to the original and yet so fresh. The change of some scenes and dialogue made the experience feel new. The graphics are beautiful and creative. The new scenes and characters were amazing. I loved the references to the original. Most of the animals are cute. Mufasa, Raifki and Timon are wise creatures. I highly recommend seeing this. "
94010,It was way better then I imagined and Beyonc did her thing
94011,"I love that they didnt over animate the characters actions. Ive watched the original thousands of times, and this remake was everything I had hoped it would be!!!"
94012,Loved it!  Stayed close to the original.
94013,"So good! So nostalgic. Very similar to cartoon, but that‚Äôs great with me because I loved that story."
94014,"The real-ness of the characters was spot on, and the more mature jokes made it better for all the adults that went to see their childhood movie. Its a lot more relatable to hamlet now."
94015,Didnt seem like it was 3D. My grandson said the same.
94016,Ordering tickets and picking seats on line is easy. Lion King 3D was excellent!
94017,"As a much older movie goer (60) I went to Lion King because it's a popular theme and for me, would be light and entertaining. I realize that I wasn't the ""Target"" market. That being said, the movie lacked what I would Consider the ""Wholesomeness"" characteristic. Some of the personalities were nice, but it just lacked completeness? Maybe an underdeveloped Child (Ages 5-7) might leave feeling Good, but anyone familiar with the theme, Not so much?

By Contrast, and to my surprise,  ALADDIN checked ALL The Boxes!"
94018,Very predictable but way more realistic made it more sad when mufasa died!
94019,I liked the music and the animations was great! So real looking
94020,The movis was great but I paid for 3D experience and i the movie wasn't 3D
94021,"Volume during the songs should have been just a tad bit louder. Not sure if it was the actual theater or the film it self. None the less, the movie was good and the audience sang along during the songs."
94022,EVERYTHING WAS BEAUTIFUL OMG!
94023,"Graphics were amazing, a lot of the new jokes didn't land well and the voices weren't great, I sat there thinking why was this even made?"
94024,"Better than expected. My Grandson who is 10 loved it. The audience joined in on Hakuna Metata, me too. It brought tears, and some laughs. Honestly the film was beautifully made. Amazing CG. "
94025,Amazing visuals and good remake of the original
94026,"Amazing and incredible movie, one of the best remakes and brings back childhood memories."
94027,It was a great movie but I still prefer the cartoon! Left some good scenes and songs out of it!!!
94028,I liked that this Lion King remake follows the cartoon original version.. a total classic I highly recommend it.
94029,I loved this film! I took me back as if I were watching it for the first time as a child  . I will definitely be seeing it again.
94030,True to the original. It was like being a little kid again
94031,"We simply didn't need this movie to be remade, especially when it lacks all of the unique personality and emotional weight behind the character's facial expressions that made the original so fun to watch. Instead what we're left with is a lifelike vapid doppelganger that's clearly just a shameless cash grab. "
94032,Fantastic. Perfectly cast. Visually stunning. Musically matches if not builds on the original. 
94033,"I thought it was adorable! Kitties were totes cuteness overload. I'd see this movie again everyday until the sun explodes, but I would die from kitty cat fuzzy fever."
94034,overall it was a good movie ..I grew up with the cartoon version and i was  more used to the original voices of the characters so I would say I like the cartoon better but the movie is good for the kids who never seen the cartoon
94035,Its a carbon copy of the original movie in concept and .  The biggest and only difference is the advanced technology that makes the characters and landscape appear to be live creatures and photographed landscape. Seeing live animals carry on  conversation was a bit disconcerting compared with the original animated characters. This new process seemed to diminish facial expression that the new technology doesnt duplicate. Thus my 3 star rating.
94036,"What does a good remake need? It requires the fine balance between retention and creation.

This Lion King has achieved this extremely well. All the touching, funny, and meaningful moments were retained. All the little changes/additions adds on to the original animated version, making it a same yet wonderfully different experience.

Highly recommend viewers to watch it, not with the ""let's see how different can this remake be"" attitude, but with the ""how can something so wonderful be remade to another level"". Love it, absolutely."
94037,Didnt capture magic of the first one. Seemed to drag and did not offer much new. The real life animals were hard to connect with. Just seemed strange at times and dragged.
94038,Too much like original.  Music was outstanding!
94039,"I grew up on the animated version of the movie, which I loved. It was full of feelings and emotion, from the acting to every song. I was excited when they started advertising the motion picture version of it, however it lacked the emotions of the original version. The acting and singing was mediocre at best and yes even Beyonc√©‚Äôs parts were very mediocre. The only thing this version did was told the story, which I feel they excluded some of the best parts from the original. I can say that this generation may actually love this movie but for those in my generation that grew up on the animated version may not as much."
94040,Very unique cinema experience. 
94041,"I loved the visual new CGI of the characters, as well the classical music that hit every note. It was hilarious and emotional and made me feel like a child again"
94042,Haven't seen the animated version in 20+ years so i enjoyed this as well! Was funnier than i remember and the cinematography was breathtaking. 
94043,"Excellent movie! I loved scenery, presentation, music and sound effects! Great movie!"
94044,Great remake!! Brings you back to your childhood!!
94045,"The live-action Lion King delivers on expectations.  The storyline maintains a nearly identical script from the animated movie.  A handful of scenes did require editing as they couldn't really be recreated in the live-action version.  However, Disney did a great job of keeping the storyline together.  Purists will pick apart differences from the original and live-action.  However, anyone who hasn't seen the animated version will find the live-action a mesmerizing experience on par with the experience purists felt in watching the animated movie the first time.  Disney is doing a great job with the live-action versions.  Purists do not want to see the movie ""changed"" in terms of script and I believe so far, Disney is doing a great job of honoring the past while bringing the content to the modern, live-action form.

Some new songs were introduced in the live-action - definitely liked the modern sound and fit well in the movie.  The biggest complaint would be a handful of the remade songs from the original soundtrack - eh, they just didn't do it for me.  Still, overall, the music score was excellent."
94046,original was better!
94047,"I think the movie did a really good job of staying true to the original film in 1994 but also bring something new to the film, Beyonc√© did a amazing job as Nala! Zazu, Timon and Pumba were hilarious in the movie."
94048,"I heard critics hated this film and I tend to agree with them on the poor quality of these reimagined Disney films. However, I liked the new Lion King. Dare I say, my favorite of the remakes. I want to make it clear THIS DOES NOT COMPETE WITH THE 1994 FILM. This film is a B/B- grade at best compared to its predecessor. It is almost a shot-for-shot remake which to traditional filmmaking is ludicrous idea since you could have watched the original film‚Äîsee how critics responded to the 'Physco' remake. Due to the poor creative ‚Äúoriginality‚Äù of Tim Burton‚Äôs Dumbo, I needed a shot-for-shot film because the Disney writers have lost touch with reality and don‚Äôt know how to capture the intelligence of the original films in their screenplays. Maybe shareholders have too much power of the studio or these movies are to pay off bigger projects in the future. One can only assume. At times, I forgot I was watching an animated film. This film will be nominated for special effects and cinematography. Jon Favreau has really pushed the boundaries of 3D animation that at times I thought I was watching a nature show on Animal Planet. This is the best and the negative part of the film. By going realistic, the facial expressions us human recognize aren't there. Mammals have a hard time reading other mammals. This is why 2D animation is a magical medium. You can make a noun‚Äîhuman, place or thing‚Äîhave human expressions which are easier for the audience to read a scene. Emotional scenes (you know the ones from '94) get lost in delivery because the characters don't look like they are responding the way we understand. Spoiler: Yes, I was disappointed with the short spoken-word version of ‚ÄòBe Prepared‚Äô, Yes, I was disappointed with the lack of ghost Mufasa, and Yes, I had a hard time deciphering characters from background to other characters BUT‚Äîand I mean but‚ÄîI rather see this remake again over the Dumbo, Aladdin, and Beauty and the Beast remakes any day. I think the other majority of the hate is coming from audiences who are tired of watching these recreations when they want something new. Disney, the masses have spoken, make original live-action films again! These remakes have become on par with the early 2000s‚Äô direct to DVD sequels."
94049,"The Lion King was my childhood, so naturally I was looking forward to seeing this movie & unfortunately it was a huge disappointment. Although I knew the storyline and it followed the exact same one, along with almost the same lines, it just didn‚Äôt flow right. I left wanting more!"
94050,"everything was just like the original, just the cgi was amazing."
94051,"My opinion: it totally ruined the cartoon one for me. I mean it was alright, but I just expected more from it. I was kinda falling asleep to it. It wasn‚Äôt the best but it wasn‚Äôt awful like Dumbo."
94052,Excellent movie! So realistic. Voices and soundtrack were better from original.
94053,Is the best live action film of the year 
94054,they did the best they could do with the concept.
94055,visually amazing n stayed true to the original
94056,"a CGI ball of dung. sure, why not?"
94057,Enjoyed it very much. Would not recommend it for small children.
94058,I felt like a kid again!!!
94059,Wonderfully mastered
94060,A cute show. But I thought it might have something a little different from the cartoon version. Still a really cute show
94061,It was just like the first one except not cartoon like. To me that should be cartoon like.
94062,Absolutely loved it! Took me back when I was younger and watched the original one.
94063,Incredible movie! The animals looked so real it really pulled you into the movie. I am already can‚Äôt wait for it to come out on video so I can purchase and watch it over and over!!
94064,I was so overwhelmed by the cinematography and music. Great movie!
94065,I love the movie. The picture was so real
94066,Really dug this movie - very true to the original and realized it didn‚Äôt need to be different. Critics can suck it.
94067,It was a lot better than I expected.
94068,This is a great movie!! It doesn't stray from the original but its visually stunning! 
94069,They did a great job remaking this classic.
94070,Great job of remaking and reintroducing it to a new gen
94071,Best Disney movie ever!!!!
94072,They butchered almost everything that is loved In the originals....
94073,animals should have more facial expressions to what was going on .
94074,I love how they didnt really change much from the original movie.
94075,"As an avid fan of the original, I waited in anticipation for this movie for months. CGI was well done. But everything else was a disappointment. I suppose when something is perfect as is (the original), it shouldn't be toyed with. The voices were just not as endearing and the overall emotin just wasnt there."
