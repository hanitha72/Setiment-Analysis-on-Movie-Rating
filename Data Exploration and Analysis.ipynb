       "array(['By 2004, they had, like, twelve adaptations of Nicholas Sparks books, and it took them this long to get around to adapting his first one. Hey, whatever, I welcome it, because this film is actually pretty good, and we seriously need compensation for \"A Walk to Remember\", not just between 2002 and 2004, but still to this day, yet that didn\\'t stop the critics from having some kind of bias that kept them from liking this. Hey, I can\\'t say that I went into this film thinking, \"From the director of \\'John Q\\' comes an adaptation of a book by the author of \\'A Walk to Remember\\' that I\\'m sure will not stink\", nor did I walk away finding it awesome, but make no mistake, this film is better than they say, even though it does have its cheesy moments. Hey, when this film came out, Ryan Gosling had just got done playing a Neo-Nazi and some teenager who brutally murdered people... in two separate films, so it was about time for him to do something a bit fluffier, much like Rachel McAdams, who just had to have been an emotional wreck after getting off of such intense projects as \"The Hot Chick\" and \"Mean Girls\". I can think of some people who would say that they were more disturbed by \"The Hot Chick\" than anything that Gosling did before this film, so I guess the match works, yet Gosling still didn\\'t immediately find his handsome, charismatic and talented self fired into the stardom that McAdams got by this film, probably because Gosling still had the integrity and, well, after this film, money to go back to doing stuff that middle-aged housewives aren\\'t likely to even hear about. I mean, don\\'t get me wrong, Gosling broke out eventually, but come on, it still took a while even after this film, though that might just be because of the mixed reviews, because, as you all know very well, the members of the pop culture who decide who becomes popular or not always listen to critics. Sarcasm aside, the audience is right in saying that Nick Sparks actually did something good before doing about 100 mediocre things, though you shouldn\\'t completely disregard the critics, as their complaints are hardly completely invalid.\\n\\nAt just over two hours, the film is somewhat lengthy, and is certainly pretty meaty, yet its concept, in a lot of areas, holds too much meat to fully juice in two hours, as reflected by story structure\\'s pacing\\'s being, like the pacing of plenty of other Nicholas Sparks novel adaptations, uneven, having enough meditative points to compel thoroughly, but still taking advantage of its main story\\'s being framed to all too often only hit highlights in exposition in a storybook, objective fashion that distances you from substance a bit, and thins out meditative value. The film will run a steady pace, only to suddenly jar things along, and while you\\'re never quite jarred loose from the film, events are often awkwardly tossed at you, and such a formula proves to be detrimental to the momentum of substance\\'s impact, whose blows are further softened by yet another hallmark in Nick Sparks stories: subtlety issues. There have been more histrionic interpretations of Sparks\\' questionable dramatic efforts, but when this film\\'s genuineness slips, its subtlety lapses range from offputting to considerable, whether when it\\'s slapping down a rather disconcertingly syrupy dramatic beat or going so far as to craft such borderline over-the-top characters as wealthy, disapproving parents antagonists, whose layers feel a particularly forced, yet are not the only questionable components to characterization depth. Our leads are at least well-portrayed enough to come off as layered and meaty, but when it\\'s all said and done, there is only so much depth in this film, and I don\\'t know if it\\'s because of the superficiality in Sparks\\' story concept or because something got lost in translation when Sparks\\' story was brought to the screen, but either way, the point is that histrionics can be fought back only so much. Needless to say, the histrionics would be more forgivable if the storytelling beats that are somewhat cheesed up weren\\'t so familiar, because if no other department in this effort feels somewhat lazy, it\\'s the originality department, which turns over stone after stone, until predictability ensues. There\\'s a twist to this film that is so easy to see coming that, before too long, the film even feels like it gives up trying to obscure it, and while that is the height in the final product\\'s predictability, it\\'s not the only predictable beat to the final product, which makes up for originality and dramatic shortcomings more often than not with considerable inspiration, but faces shortcomings nevertheless, falling short of its full potential. With that said, the final product doesn\\'t quite fall so far from grace that it doesn\\'t reward, having many a flaw, but ultimately quite a few more strengths, even in the photographic department.\\n\\nThe film isn\\'t stunning, or at least not consistently so, yet when cinematographer Robert Fraisse\\'s eye catches the right environment, the visual results range from striking or truly gorgeous, boasting a soulful grace that catches your eyes when it is infused in Fraisse\\'s photography, as surely as it grips your attention when it is infused in Aaron Zigman\\'s score, which is a bit formulaic and minimalist, but lovely and heartfelt, with a distinguished flavor that proves to be comfortably compatible with the substance that it compliments so well. Aesthetically, the film accels with a graceful taste that does a fine job of breathing soul into flawed substance, whose effectiveness is ameliorated a bit by the filmmakers\\' aesthetic punch-ups, but, quite frankly, doesn\\'t need pretty visuals and nice tunes to gain your attention. Nicholas Sparks\\' story concept is, of course, flawed, being derivative and with its share of subtlety issues, but when you step back and see through all of the hiccups, you can find one of Sparks\\' most worthy concepts, and while such a concept is not fleshed out nearly as much as it could have been in execution, it\\'s rich with endearing heart that cannot be ignored, especially when emphasized by what is, in fact, done right in Jeremy Leven\\'s and Jan Sardi\\'s script, and, of course, Nick Cassavetes\\' direction. Even outside of this film, Cassavetes isn\\'t exactly notorious for his genuineness as a teller of a conceptually resonant tale, and sure enough, the histrionic value in the film is all too often milked for all its worth, yet for every somewhat overblown dramatic beat, Cassavetes delivers a resonant punch that gives you a taste of what could have been, and firmly reminds you of what ultimately is, a very compelling drama that, in spite of its shortcomings, wins you over time and again. By the time we reach the final act, the film really starts to pierce with sentimentality that is backed enough by genuineness and soul to all but move you to tears, and while this story concept deserves to have more of that punch, perhaps even at a greater intensity, golden occasions can be found the in midst of a compellingness that, while often diluted, never dissipates, being backed by much in the way of inspiration, both off of the screen and on the screen. The acting isn\\'t killer, but it is strong across the board, with James Garner and Gena Rowlands ultimately delivering on sparkling chemistry and emotional range in their portrayal of good, but old and deteriorating souls, while the dashing Ryan Gosling and gorgeous Rachel McAdams carry most of the film with their distinguished charismas, bonded through powerful chemistry, and backed with a human emotional resonance that is more layered than the actual written characterization of the Noah Calhoun and Allison \"Allie\" Hamilton characters, who are well-defined enough by their portrayers to engross as worthy leads. Many are not likely to walk away loving this film, but it is rather underappreciated, being flawed something fierce, but ultimately with enough inspiration and rich soul to thoroughly engage and ultimately reward.\\n\\nOverall, pacing unevenness keeps the film from soaking up its full depth, whose kick goes further diluted by subtlety issues and conventionalism, until you\\'re left with a flawed final product, but one that still compels, using lovely cinematography and score work to compliment the taste within Nicholas Sparks\\' undeniably meaty story concept, which is brought to life well enough by Nick Cassevetes\\' direction and a strong cast for \"The Notebook\" to ultimately stand as a flawed, but quite good melodrama that rewards the patient.\\n\\n3/5 - Good'],\n",

      "[\"The notebook.  Upon searching the best romantic films, this seems to be at the top of the pile?  WHY?\\nSo, let's get into the story.   A story about a girl and a love triangle.  A girl that can't decide if she wants a bit of rough, someone who looks good with a beard, a wife beater vest and who can build things (like a house), OR.. if she wants money, someone with a good job, health insurance, keeps you hydrated and looks good in a suit.\\nAnd that's it really, a few sub plots in the future but mainly her trying to decide who she wants to be with throughout; in this utterly clichéd bullsh$t film.\\n\\nNext the characters. So the Girl:  Indecisive.  Doesn't really do a lot for feminists. She gets married to the money and then cheats with the rough. Fantastic. Complete b*tch.\\nThen, Gosling: mental problems and a narcissist.  Can't take no for an answer - in the beginning, when he gets rejected five or six times, threatens to kill himself for a date.  Sooo romantic! Later on, he writes her a letter every day for years..who does that?  ..Psychos!  Oh yeah, and he a builds a house for her.  From scratch, with no training. (I wouldn't live there - health and safety)\\nAnd then Marsden: nice guy.  But boring and stupid.  Kind of knows that his girl is thinking about another man, but you know, just gets on with it...as you do.\\nNot to mention the other insane characters in this film.  The girl's mother for example who just the worst mother.  Doesn't want to her daughter to make any choices, hides mail from her.  You know, just a c@unt.\\n\\nOk, what we got left?  Pace: really slow.  too slow. Direction: garbage.  Music score: Soppy and unnecessary.  Cinematography: average.  Costume design: awful.\\nActing: alright.  \\nAnd there we go....  BEST ROMANTIC FILM EVER.  jokers.\", 'Excelente,  sensibiliza la trama.', \"It's a cheesy love story.

The movie starts off with an interesting flashback scene that sets up the whole movie and the cast fit the role quite well for grown versions of themselves. As the story progresses the theme of love and stereotypical norms of society at the time. Ex. the girl is from rich family the boy is a poor worker. They fall in love and the details are some what cliche; however, if you are into that stuff you do you. Anyways skip into the rising action and the romantic elements can be seen clearly as the extenuate the theme of young love and also serve as a reminder to the audience of what love should be like. This may entice feelings in the viewer building further emotional connection. Then the climax of the movie occurs and the couple is split in traditional rage/anger and the viewers are exposed to the blinding realities of love and the effects it can have on one. The man grows up and builds his dream house and the girl eventually finds it after being separated. There are some intricate details about note writing that went ignored for many years and this concept hits hard but is again cliche and the dialogue is somewhat confusing around the situation. Then fast forward the couple makes up and there is a flash of romanticism yet again and the self-discovery that occurs from the character's separation is shown. This helps make the story happy and leads to a powerful ending. The ending is then further twisted for the better when it is revealed that the flashback old couple is the one from the past and the wife is getting told the story from the man (she has alzheimers and cannot remember). she is able to recount her memories one last time before forgetting and starting the day all over again. This is a sweet ending and definitely one that is memorable. Overall, the storyline was cliche and somewhat dragged out unnecessarily; however, the performance of the cast and support from soundtrack put the movie together in a good way. Additionally, the ending and it's influence on future romance movies set a groundbreaking precedence. I rate it 7.5/10. Would not recommend watching alone but watch it.\", 'Romances like this one don\\'t usually get made anymore so it\\'s just wonderful to have an unabashedly romantic, cheesy film of this type starring modern actors to enjoy. Ryan Gosling\\'s unattractiveness prevents me from loving the film but Rachel McAdams, Sam Shepard and Joan Allen give such great, sometimes campy, performances that it\\'s hard not to get swept up in the experience. This is definitely a female fantasy film as Gosling is regularly objectified and a man waits around for years and years for a woman to return to him while she gets an equally appealing prospect in James Marsden. No real reason is giving for their falling in love and we find out about their relationship through a montage and some voiceover but in the 21st century you have to take what you can get.\\n\\nAllie Hamilton, Rachel McAdams, is a wealthy young woman living in 1940s South Carolina who falls deeply in love with the poor but charming Noah Calhoun, Ryan Gosling, over the summer. The two part when Allie\\'s judgmental mother Anne, Joan Allen, bars Noah from seeing Allie and his attempts to contact her during the war are blocked by her. Allie meets the equally wealthy Lon Hammond Jr., James Marsden, but she doesn\\'t feel as strongly about him as Noah and when the two reunite she finds herself falling back in love with him despite the obstacles they face. We also witness an elderly man, James Garner, reading their story to a woman who has dementia, Gena Rowlands, I\\'d be surprised if you couldn\\'t figure out who they were by the end of the film.\\n\\nAll of the clichÃ (C)s are present in this film as we have the Romeo and Juliet formula, the love triangle and the elderly versions of the characters reminiscing but this film does them so well. Allen is great as the emotionally wounded mother who expects her daughter to face the same fate as she has and reject true love in the place of a wealthy, reliable who she doesn\\'t truly love. Marsden is charming as Hammond Jr. and he does seem achingly sincere as he lets Allie walk off into the sunset and having Gena Rowlands tearfully recognize her husband is manipulative but if you have talent like that it would be a crime not to use it. You have to accept immediately that the world the film lives in will allow Noah and Allie to end up together no matter what and if you are capable of suspending your disbelief you can really enjoy this hunk of cheese.\\n\\nThe likability of the lead actress also can\\'t be counted out as McAdams makes a character who could easily seem annoying with her lack of backbone throughout the first half of the film. The most common problem that romantic films have is that the leading lady or character is either extremely bland or intensely dislikable but The Notebook avoids this by making Allie charming and intelligent even while she struggles to stand up for what she really wants. McAdams looks like she\\'s in a Jo-Ann Fabric and Craft Stores ad throughout the whole film as her face glows, her dimples pop and she wears an endless array of stylish 1950s dresses but more than just her look McAdams has that \"it factor\" that makes her endlessly endearing.\\n\\nThe cinematography is also gorgeous as the Carolina region of the United States, seen in every Nicholas Sparks adaptation, looks like a postcard. When the two go out on a rowboat and encounter some doves while dappled light hits McAdams just right it\\'s every girls dream. The sex scene should also reveal special mention as the famous argument in the rain that precedes it builds up the sexual tension and when they get down to it we see nice little details like Allie\\'s pearls getting in the way. It\\'s not up there with Don\\'t Look Now (1973) as an artistic achievement but it\\'s pretty damn sexy for a PG-13 film.\\n\\nThis is a film for the ladies only, in my experience, and although there will be some uncomfortable moments if you watch this with your mother it is a staple of sleepovers and hangouts with your female friends. It\\'s no Brief Encounter (1945) but it\\'s a great mainstream version of a story that\\'s been told since the beginning of time.', \"The Notebook to me is the second best romance film of all time beaten out only by Ryan Gosling's 2016 masterpiece La La Land. The Notebook is sweet, romantic, and is a story within a story. The external plot of Duke in the nursing home is sweet and it allows you to sympathize with older couples as well as people who suffer from dementia. The beginning of the story is nice and Ryan does a beautiful job bringing emotion to Noah. Rachel McAdams also pulls off a convincing Allie that goes through a lot of character development. Noah spends the whole movie infatuated with Allie and it works. Allie however has the more interesting arc as her character starts as a prim rich girl who moves into a radical, fun loving, passionate, risky girl for the time period. She then is forced to go back to her roots only to end up back in his arms. The whole movie is filled to the brink with iconic and beautiful scenes that are constructed specifically to make your heart melt. Its ups are high and its lows are way down low but I think that that just adds to the experience.\", 'The Notebook is a romantic movie about two lovers, Noah and Allie, who spend a delightful summer together in South Carolina. The couple falls quickly in love only to run into a few conflicts down the road. Allie is from a very wealthy family and Noah is a mill worker who comes from a very poor family. Due to this circumstance, the realities of the time prevented the two from seeing each other. This part of the movie shows the conflicts of social classes among relationships in the 1940\\'s. Despite their differences, Noah continues to fight for Allie with every ounce of love in his body. Once Allie moves off to college, leaving Noah behind, Noah writes letters to her every single day for a year. I personally love this part of the movie because it shows the true connection and commitment Noah had to Allie. In the movie Noah says, \"I wrote you 365 letters. I wrote you every day for a year. It wasn\\'t overï¿ 1/2 it still isn\\'t over.\" This movie truly emphasizes the meaning of love in the way that Noah dedicates himself to to the girl he loves. As time passes on, Noah and Allie try to move on from one another. Noah joins the war and Allie meets a new young man. Allie surprisingly falls in love with the man she met and quickly gets engaged. The new young man is rich and wealthy and everything her parents could imagine for her however it wasn\\'t enough. It almost seemed like Allie forgot about Noah completely until one day when she saw an add for Noah and his new house in the paper. At that very moment all of Allie\\'s feelings came rushing back to her. Although Noah and Allies relationship was complicated by all means, Allie decides to go see Noah to check in on him. During the weekend Noah and Allie have lots of fun as well as arguments. During one of their fights Noah says, \"Its not gonna be easy. Its going to be really hard; we\\'re gonna have to work at this everyday, but I want to do that because I want you.\" I love this quote because of the reality it brings to real life. Relationships can often be complicated and life can often be hard but it is something that you have to work with to get to where you want to be. One of my favorite quotes from the movie is when Noah gives Allie advice, \"You cant live your life for other people. You\\'ve got to do what\\'s right for you, even if it hurts some people you love.\" This is my favorite quote because it is something that I often need to remind myself as well. Noah is telling Allie to do whats best for her and to think about herself for once instead of letting the worlds expectations get in the way. Once Allie and Noahs weekend comes to an end, Allie is left with a difficult decision regarding Noah and her Fiancï¿ 1/2 (C). She is left to choose between two men who both mean the world to her. I recommend this movie to everyone because I believe it shows the true definition of love between two people. The Notebook has lots of conflict and challenge within it but no matter what Noah keeps trying to push through and move forward with his life. I believe this movie is one of the best romantic dramas out there and hope other people enjoy it as much as I did.', 'really mushy love story, very predictable from the start, i knew almost instantly the old lady was her and recognized small refrences that were shown later. still a really good movie though, i really enjoyed it, a fantastic romance and rachel mcadams is perfect as always', 'I normally hate dramas, rather watch anything else. But this one, I actually had tears in my eyes at the end.', 'Hallmark card in motion........... beautiful to watch from a visual perspective, dissatisfying from any other.', 'If you want a movie that will make you cry, then this is definitely the  movie for you. This is by far my favorite movie and could watch it everyday all day.I remember watching this movie when I was probably 6-7 yrs old. I feel like it had a good plot and the climax of the movie is fantastic.The climax really makes the movie in my opinion.  The characterization that the writer used is amazing. The work that the director and the write did really payed off. Definitely recommend watching this movie, with friends, boyfriends or girlfriends or just by yourself.', 'It was a great movie.', 'This movie is a new time CLASSIC! If youï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)re a romantic at all, this movie will draw at your heartstrings, make you laugh and feel the emotions of new love, and will give you a cry (in a great way) and hopefully set a new standard in your mind for the love youï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)re willing to except. Iï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)m convinced that critics of this movie either have never experienced this type of love, or never have seen it modeled in their life before. Itï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)s a movie that stands the test of time, WATCH!', 'Rachel McAdams recommended viewing.', \"This is a incredibly good movie, although I have yet to read the novel. I never really thought that I liked watching romantic movies but this film changed my mind. Throughout the movie, you will get incredibly attached to the characters. The story line will give almost anyone a sense of relativity to this movie. To anyone that is out there wondering if you should watch it, I highly recommend it even if you're not a big fan of romance films..(Beware, this movie has an alternate ending if you're watching it on Netflix in the UK)..Enjoy!\", \"Perhaps the defining romance film of its generation.\\n\\nThe Notebook (2004) is an emotional romance drama from the writings of Nicholas Sparks. While the tone is sentimental and drama cliche, I still enjoy The Notebook. I have seen this movie 4 times now, and I must admit, I like it more every time I view it.\\n\\nNick Cassavetes has a particularly stunning style of direction with his sleek shots and wide natural perspective. His eye for showing different viewpoints of characters is quite effective. His close-ups of faces reveal the pain and longing in their eyes. I forgot how iconic several shots within The Notebook really are, honestly. Rachel McAdams in the rain or Ryan Gosling awaking to her return on the balcony are brilliantly done. The movie runs on for a bit too long and drags a little towards the end, but I still feel like it connects emotionally.\\n\\nRachel McAdams is wonderful as Allie. Her charisma and charm exude from the screen with a radiant likable feeling. McAdams captures Allie's conflicting loves and her passionate love with a realistic true to life performance.\\n\\nLikewise, Ryan Gosling plays the charming Noah, whose initial warmth and likable persona is hardened by time and pain that Gosling conveys quite well. Gosling deserves more credit as an actor that has chronicled all the emotions a man can feel in a relationship over the course of his career. He is delightful and sympathetic in The Notebook.\\n\\nThe other supporting roles do a great job in their respective parts in The Notebook. James Garner is endearing as Duke also known as the elderly Noah. His sincerity and love for his wife is palpable due to Garner's strong performance. Gena Rowlands has the unenviable task of portraying dementia with a sad realism. She gives a nuanced acting display of empathy and confusion. I also have to mention that Sam Shepard is very nice as Noah's kindly father. James Marsden is believable as the perfect rich man Lon Hammond, whose wealth and looks mean little compared to the grounded and romantic Gosling.\\n\\nOverall, The Notebook may not be a classic film, but it is a riveting romance tale with genuine emotion that hits me harder with each viewing of The Notebook.\", \"A not very thrilling story. I will give The Notebook this though. I was sobbing at the end.

The director starts the film off in a nursing home with an elderly husband reading to his wife who has dementia. The viewer later finds out that this is Noah telling Allie the story of how they fell in love trying very hard to get her to remember something from their past.  The story takes place in the late 1930s, following a wealthy young women, Allie Hamilton, and a lower class local worker, Noah Calhoun. They fall madly in love with one another but are separated by social differences. Noah served in World War II and Allie went off to become engaged to a wealthy man. When Allie sees that Noah purchased and rebuilt the dream that they fantasize about when they were together, she goes back to where they fell in love and they rekindle their love for one another. The doctors and their children tell Noah that there is no use in him telling Allie the story because she will never remember him or anything from her past. He disregards everyone's advice and keeps telling Allie their love story. Even through the toughest of times family never gives up on one another.\", 'The Notebook is a beautiful movie where two people from completely different social classes and backgrounds fall in love with all odds against them. The movie displays social stigmas, class differences, love, sacrifice, loss, marriage, family and heartbreak. It encompasses how true love will always find its way back. Love knows no boundaries and with sacrifice, choice, and commitment it always prevails. It scratches the surface of breaking societal norms and puts family and love at the forefront of what matters in life.

Many complain that Nicholas Sparks is repetitive, unoriginal, unrealistic, and manipulates emotions. To some degree, these \"haters\" have a point--Sparks is very formulaic, and he does rely on the whirlwind romances, and his stories are blissful, beautiful, and magical like fairy tales, and they do all end with illness and horror and death. However, there is validity in what these \"haters\" have to say. Many claim Sparks uses the same formula for all of his tales. He begins all, or almost all of his books and movies, with a whirlwind romance. Everything is blissful and beautiful and magical, and as quickly as the characters hearts are all wrapped up in attaining a fairy tale ending, something bad, usually death or illness, presents itself. The story usually end fairly quickly after one of the main characters die, leaving the readers disappointed and wanting more. This can be rather frustrating for readers and there is truth in what these people have to say.

I just remember it enough to know that I hated it. So there we have The Notebook.\", \"With Titanic becoming the most popular film of all time financially for 12 years since its release in 1997, so many romance films after it have copied its doomed forbidden love premise and told stories of it to death. The worst thing about it is that Titanic wasn't even original to begin with. The Notebook is probably the most popular love story in the post-Titanic era to achieve great success with that premise with audiences and at the box office. Quite simply put, this film annoys me. Not only is it unoriginal in its storytelling but the entire film is treacle. It's always trying to make you care for the characters and their predicaments and is manipulative as ever in that approach. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are two good looking and charismatic leads but their characters have absolutely no reason to fall in love. Their first encounter is bafflingly idiotic in how it leads to them becoming an item and when their relationship comes to a halt at one point, so many contrivances take place that try to keep you in suspense as to what will become of them when it's painfully obvious from the outset what will happen. My dislike coming from this film isn't that I hate romance stories. Many of my favourite films are love stories. But they're all love stories that make sense and don't feel contrived in any way. The whole film is shamelessly corny and sentimental and not up my alley for sure. However, for Nicholas Sparks, it's shockingly one of his better films.\", 'SOB, SOB, SOB, SOB, SOB. Eat me. The Notebook is the quintessential \"take the happy things from Romeo and Juliet, and leave the sad stuff out\" chick flick. An old woman with dementia needs a story of true life, and an old man visits her to satisfy her needs by telling her the story of how the two met and fell in love. Unnecessary narrative, but okay. The setting is the 1940s in a Southern rural town, where a young (17), prosperous Rachel McAdams meets the irresistible, but trashy Ryan Gosling. They have a sweet romance for two dumb youths, until a pregnancy scare and Gosling being drafted into the war separates their love. That\\'s that, yes? McAdams meets another man, James Marsden, several years later, who is not only rich like her family, but is far more understanding and compromising than Gosling ever was. Need I say whom McAdams ends up with, by the forcefully sweet end? Look at the cheesy romance novel poster. That still is a good example of how bombastically sappy The Notebook is. McAdams is vaguely secluded, while Gosling is vaguely adventurous. Gosling nearly risks both his and her life by inviting her to the time of her life: lying on the road until a truck nearly runs them over. Kids, huh? And when they\\'re adults, they maintain a good run by canoeing through a lake filled (and I mean FILLED) with ducks. Whoever is to blame for that, thanks for the laugh. I enjoyed indulging, but sometimes, I was urked by the theme, \"Your first love is your true love. Never let it slip.\"\\n\\nThe cinematography was acceptable in some scenes, and questionable in others. The first few shots are in slow motion, depicting a sunset on a lake with birds flying overhead towards a nursing home. These birds appear again at the end of the film, perhaps comparing Gosling and McAdams to such. They are free as birds, to fly together...? Okay. Aren\\'t we all? It\\'s not that provocative of a message. If anything, McAdams was freer when she was planning to wed Marsden later in the movie. There were other odd shots, like how the actors duck under the camera shot to remove their clothes, leaving us with a blank screen for a few seconds per person. I don\\'t care that much, but I wondered if they considered other PG-13 ways of undressing. And yes, the sex scenes were a little clumsy. Even the sound mixing stood out. Between lines, ambient sound boosted to a volume louder than Gosling and McAdams, then swiftly quiet down the noises when people spoke. Don\\'t blame the sound mixer entirely though, as there were many long pauses. McAdams had some stage life, while Gosling pushed himself through every scene with the same too-stoned-to-care facial expression and the mumbling Southern monotone. Chick flicks aren\\'t really my thing, and I only watched The Notebook to mock it.', \"The Notebook is a movie about two peoples journey and it makes you hope they get together.  It was directed by Nick Cassavettes who prior to this was best known for John Q which is about a father, who doesn't have the insurance to pay for his son's heart transplant so he takes the hospital's emergency room hostage until the doctors agree to perform the operation.  Back to this movie though, it is based off the novel written by Nicholas Sparks, Jan Sardi was in charge of adapting the novel into film and Jeremy Leven wrote the screenplay.\\n\\nI have to admit, I don't normally gravitate to the love story movies, I feel like that is because that is because I enjoy action and comedy more but I wanted to broaden my movie perspective and take on a different genre.  This story starts with an old man who is in a nursing home and he reads a story to an old woman each day. The story he reads is about these two young lovers named Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) and Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams). They met one evening at a carnival many years ago. They fall in love but Allies parents dissapprove of Noah because of his lack of wealth, and they force the two to break up and Allie moves back home. She waits for Noah to write her for several years, but gets nothing so she moves on and meets and becomes engaged to a handsome young soldier named Lon (James Marsden).  Then while getting fitted for her wedding dress she looks at a local newspaper and Noah's picture catches her eye. He is standing in front of a fully restored, 200-year-old home. Allie then passes out because that is the house he told her he would restore for them.  Needing to clear the air and see if Noah is okay, and tell him about her marriage she goes to see him. They both still have feelings deep in their hearts for each other, feelings that have lasted all these years, and even though she is engage this is love like no other.  It wasn't over but she was engaged....\\n\\nThe scene where they are lying in the road is my favorite of this movie because it shows when she first really begins to trust him.  Also it shows the more fun side of her, plus there is a little bit of humor which as a said before I lean towards those types of movies so I am glad to see their was some funny parts in this movie.\\n\\nI have to say that Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams have amazing chemistry, I felt that they truly fell for each other and were in love from the minute he was hanging from the ferris wheel.  I have seen movies where the two playing the love interests struggle to make a connection but that was not the case here.  These two lit up the screen like magic from the second they were together it was amazing.\\n\\nOverall I would give this movie a A-.  The story is just amazing about how these two fall in love, get disconnected and then they reconnect.. granted there is the factor that she is engaged which is always a bum factor but does she stay with him or does she pick Noah.  I can't tell you.  If you haven't seen it yet you will just have to go watch it to figure that one out!\", 'Great date night movie but can also ruin your relationship so be careful.

There's going to be some moments that the viewers are going to tear up as it's really effective. The supporting cast is great, and the set from 1940 looks really nice. The soundtrack is good, and I thought the plot is decent for a love story. The script does give in to a lot of manipulation which can make it a bit obvious about who's going with who, and it is your standard love story with a bit of a sad ending which is very effective. I think the reason why I only like this one and not others is because the other Nicholas Sparks films tried so hard to be like The Notebook that it just downright fails. There's some that tried to be a little different, but they had a lot of problems that made me hate it.

It is a tale of passionate love told in a classical way. \\nExcept love, the power is portrayed in the movie. Anne Hamilton, the mother of Allie, married John Hamilton who is Allie's father. She leads Allie to see his ex-boyfriend who is working in the farm and do not have money, power and social position. She told Allie that she wants to elope with him when she was young but this action was omitted by the policeman. She does not feel regret because she loves John and he has power and money. She wants to let Allie know if she elopes with her ex-boyfriend successfully, she will have nothing. In her position, the power is more important than love because power can bring a stable life for her. Her behaviour let many couples to think power and love, which one be more important? \\nThis type of love story is a classic because it is used in many different films and novels. Most romantic stories have a common plot where the protagonist finds love in someone but something happens which makes them unable to be together. Then the love-stricken character struggles to keep love aflame despite a lot of difficulties. In the end, the couple manages to stay together. When this formula for romance is used in a film, the audience can feel a little bored.  However, the Notebook manages to maintain the hearts and minds of the viewer for the entire two and a half hours.  This is because of the amazing and passionate on-screen chemistry of Allie played by Rachel McAdams.\\nAnother element that sets this story apart from other classic love tales, is the way the director organizes the sequence of events. Flashbacks between the past and the present are weaved seamlessly throughout. In the film, an old man is reading a story to an old woman, which makes people feel the old man is the narrator who just tells the story and leads the plot development. The old woman gets senile dementia, which makes her to live in the old people's home. Noah is the protagonist in the story and Allie is the person who is loved by Noah. They have a lovely story. \\nThe main actors Ryan Gosling and Rachael McAdams (young Noah and young Allie), coincidentally, were born in the same city of London, Ontario in Canada. Ryan's rugged good looks, and charming demeanor will make every woman swoon. Rachael McAdam's eyes like thousands of constellations bestrew the sky that spark the glamour and curly long hair are able to make a stamp in every man's heart. After the movie released, the on screen couple took their love across the movie into reality. During mid-2005 to mid-2007, Rachael Mcdams dated Ryan Gosling. In mid-2008, they briefly reunited. So people will find how satisfying of this movie that shows the love from young to old and from fiction to non-fiction. \\nThe setting successful combines a quiet and boisterous atomosphere. Quiet illustrates the love in the peaceful environment. Boisterous shows the love still survived after the suffering. If you can imagine, the peaceful environment is that couples are paddling the boat on the lake, which draw a beautiful picture for the audience. Perfect combination will make audience feel the grateful of love. It is a warm and sweet picture for the audience. In here, two people are reuniting together although they leave with each other seven years. On the boat, two people are enjoying the love and reminding them past experiences, which they include happiness and sadness stories that they suffered.\\nNick uses The Notebook reflects United States of America history during the 1940s. In that time, the World War II happened that lead many man joined the war. As we know, the capitalism was developed very fast in that time, which would cause the social division increased. The lower classes such as labour and farmer did not have enough money that cause them have onerous works but get lower paid. Nick reflects these situations successfully.\\nOne thing that I really admired is the composure that the characters show when they must see their love in the arms of another. It is better to set your love free rather than enforce a love that does not belong to you. Unwilling love will never bring happiness.\\nNick Cassavetes makes a successful love movie because it lets people recognize the power of love and its ability to shape our entire life. \\nAll in all, The Notebook is an awesome movie.

The Notebook is hands down one of the best movies of all time. It is without a doubt up to par with the novel, as well. The film was masterfully done, and the characters could not have been chosen more perfectly. Phenomenal performances by the entire cast.

Also, just before you begin to hate me for rating this movie 1 star, let me tell you why I rated this movie 1 star. Director Nick Cassavetes is not the worst director of all time, don\\'t get me wrong, but I felt like after I was done watching the credits roll until the end, I did not feel any sense of learning something new or the sense of having new ideas flowing into the walls of my brain. When it comes down to watching Drama(s), it is very hard for me to like it without being overwhelmed just by watching the sexuality that the Motion Picture offers to us. In many cases, the sexuality is completely overrated and the acting is just terrible as well. Ryan Gosling seemed to fit along the lines of sexuality pretty well, but for this kind of movie, where Cassavetes using his won style and technique to bring the full width of the movie to life, there could have been a better actor to better that major role. Rachel McAdams also fits along the lines of where Gosling is. Just have better actors/actresses to do these different roles. It is a lot of work, it takes a long time to find these good actors/actresses, but if you have the time and money (in which most Directors have) to find these people, you have the A Team right there in front of you to get the job done. In the end, where it comes down to movies leaving an impact tot he world of film and its respective societies, The Notebook (2004) left nothing but a Motion Picture with color and talent. I am on both sides with the people that rate this movie 5 stars, just make sure that you have a good and clear argument to back up your thesis so it is valid. Just like many other reviewers and super reviewers, I am not only focusing my gaze on the 5 star reviewers, but the \"in-between people\" as well.', \"I'm a sucker for love stories\", 'Do not underestimate The Notebook.

He also directed famous movies such as \"The Hangover Part2\", \"My sister\\'s Keeper\" and so on. I like \"My sister\\'s keeper\" too. I heared that he made this movie independently so I supposed that things he wanted to tell the audience were reflected directly. It is rare that the director who plays an active part as a professional make an independent movie so I thought that was why I was a little confused with understanding his thoughts.\\n Please let me explain about this story. One old woman who got dementia could not remember all of her memories because of her disease. One day, an old man by the name of \"Duke\" came to visit the old woman and read one romance story to her. The story is about one boy named Noah and one girl named Allie. As the old woman heard the story, she finally noticed that the girl named Allie in the story was herself. And the old man who read the book to the old woman was the boy named Noah. He was the husband of the old woman. He wanted the old woman to remind their memories so he believed her and tried to read about their memories again and again.\\nWhen I was watching this movie, I was moved by scene settings, story, all harmonious background music and actors. The director tends to make scenes very dark and quiet in this movie so it made all scenes impressive for me. Sometimes I was likely to cry because of the great choice of back ground music. I think sound effects play a very important role to make the movie interesting. And also I was impressed by their act. Ryan Gosling who acted the boy named Noah was especially nice. His heartrending act brought tears to my eyes. The editor also made rapid shifts of scenes many times, so I was so excited and the technique gave me the feeling of being in the movie.

So it has never been how much the others can provide you but how much are you willing to sacrifice to contribute to others. With that part understood and done well, that would be \"love\" in its purest form, untouched and uncontaminated.\\n\\nI do believe that love comes from the heart and its intention would be the most sanctified of all other thoughts. However, if we process the original love with our brain, it tells us otherwise. Our brain is a calculative, cold and unhallowed central processing unit that we have. It informs us with what\\'s best and what\\'s the most feasible for our plan. Sometimes, it deceives us and transforms us into a wicked, inconsiderate and detached person that we seek to avoid.

Although I didn\\'t manage to hear the whole soundtrack that is in the film due to quite a lot of reasons but I guess the background music and sound effect should have set the right tempo and feel for most scenes.\\n\\nHowever, I couldn\\'t help but to notice this film bearing some similarities to my all-time favourite, Forrest Gump.

I figured out it was their story before the lunch break.', 'This movie made me cry!!', 'Girls=This movie is amazing if ur looking for a movie to watch with your girlfriends or your boyfriend!', 'By 2004, they had, like, twelve adaptations of Nicholas Sparks books, and it took them this long to get around to adapting his first one. Hey, whatever, I welcome it, because this film is actually pretty good, and we seriously need compensation for \"A Walk to Remember\", not just between 2002 and 2004, but still to this day, yet that didn\\'t stop the critics from having some kind of bias that kept them from liking this. Hey, I can\\'t say that I went into this film thinking, \"From the director of \\'John Q\\' comes an adaptation of a book by the author of \\'A Walk to Remember\\' that I\\'m sure will not stink\", nor did I walk away finding it awesome, but make no mistake, this film is better than they say, even though it does have its cheesy moments. Hey, when this film came out, Ryan Gosling had just got done playing a Neo-Nazi and some teenager who brutally murdered people... in two separate films, so it was about time for him to do something a bit fluffier, much like Rachel McAdams, who just had to have been an emotional wreck after getting off of such intense projects as \"The Hot Chick\" and \"Mean Girls\". I can think of some people who would say that they were more disturbed by \"The Hot Chick\" than anything that Gosling did before this film, so I guess the match works, yet Gosling still didn\\'t immediately find his handsome, charismatic and talented self fired into the stardom that McAdams got by this film, probably because Gosling still had the integrity and, well, after this film, money to go back to doing stuff that middle-aged housewives aren\\'t likely to even hear about. I mean, don\\'t get me wrong, Gosling broke out eventually, but come on, it still took a while even after this film, though that might just be because of the mixed reviews, because, as you all know very well, the members of the pop culture who decide who becomes popular or not always listen to critics. Sarcasm aside, the audience is right in saying that Nick Sparks actually did something good before doing about 100 mediocre things, though you shouldn\\'t completely disregard the critics, as their complaints are hardly completely invalid.\\n\\nAt just over two hours, the film is somewhat lengthy, and is certainly pretty meaty, yet its concept, in a lot of areas, holds too much meat to fully juice in two hours, as reflected by story structure\\'s pacing\\'s being, like the pacing of plenty of other Nicholas Sparks novel adaptations, uneven, having enough meditative points to compel thoroughly, but still taking advantage of its main story\\'s being framed to all too often only hit highlights in exposition in a storybook, objective fashion that distances you from substance a bit, and thins out meditative value. The film will run a steady pace, only to suddenly jar things along, and while you\\'re never quite jarred loose from the film, events are often awkwardly tossed at you, and such a formula proves to be detrimental to the momentum of substance\\'s impact, whose blows are further softened by yet another hallmark in Nick Sparks stories: subtlety issues. There have been more histrionic interpretations of Sparks\\' questionable dramatic efforts, but when this film\\'s genuineness slips, its subtlety lapses range from offputting to considerable, whether when it\\'s slapping down a rather disconcertingly syrupy dramatic beat or going so far as to craft such borderline over-the-top characters as wealthy, disapproving parents antagonists, whose layers feel a particularly forced, yet are not the only questionable components to characterization depth. Our leads are at least well-portrayed enough to come off as layered and meaty, but when it\\'s all said and done, there is only so much depth in this film, and I don\\'t know if it\\'s because of the superficiality in Sparks\\' story concept or because something got lost in translation when Sparks\\' story was brought to the screen, but either way, the point is that histrionics can be fought back only so much. Needless to say, the histrionics would be more forgivable if the storytelling beats that are somewhat cheesed up weren\\'t so familiar, because if no other department in this effort feels somewhat lazy, it\\'s the originality department, which turns over stone after stone, until predictability ensues. There\\'s a twist to this film that is so easy to see coming that, before too long, the film even feels like it gives up trying to obscure it, and while that is the height in the final product\\'s predictability, it\\'s not the only predictable beat to the final product, which makes up for originality and dramatic shortcomings more often than not with considerable inspiration, but faces shortcomings nevertheless, falling short of its full potential. With that said, the final product doesn\\'t quite fall so far from grace that it doesn\\'t reward, having many a flaw, but ultimately quite a few more strengths, even in the photographic department.\\n\\nThe film isn\\'t stunning, or at least not consistently so, yet when cinematographer Robert Fraisse\\'s eye catches the right environment, the visual results range from striking or truly gorgeous, boasting a soulful grace that catches your eyes when it is infused in Fraisse\\'s photography, as surely as it grips your attention when it is infused in Aaron Zigman\\'s score, which is a bit formulaic and minimalist, but lovely and heartfelt, with a distinguished flavor that proves to be comfortably compatible with the substance that it compliments so well. Aesthetically, the film accels with a graceful taste that does a fine job of breathing soul into flawed substance, whose effectiveness is ameliorated a bit by the filmmakers\\' aesthetic punch-ups, but, quite frankly, doesn\\'t need pretty visuals and nice tunes to gain your attention. Nicholas Sparks\\' story concept is, of course, flawed, being derivative and with its share of subtlety issues, but when you step back and see through all of the hiccups, you can find one of Sparks\\' most worthy concepts, and while such a concept is not fleshed out nearly as much as it could have been in execution, it\\'s rich with endearing heart that cannot be ignored, especially when emphasized by what is, in fact, done right in Jeremy Leven\\'s and Jan Sardi\\'s script, and, of course, Nick Cassavetes\\' direction. Even outside of this film, Cassavetes isn\\'t exactly notorious for his genuineness as a teller of a conceptually resonant tale, and sure enough, the histrionic value in the film is all too often milked for all its worth, yet for every somewhat overblown dramatic beat, Cassavetes delivers a resonant punch that gives you a taste of what could have been, and firmly reminds you of what ultimately is, a very compelling drama that, in spite of its shortcomings, wins you over time and again. By the time we reach the final act, the film really starts to pierce with sentimentality that is backed enough by genuineness and soul to all but move you to tears, and while this story concept deserves to have more of that punch, perhaps even at a greater intensity, golden occasions can be found the in midst of a compellingness that, while often diluted, never dissipates, being backed by much in the way of inspiration, both off of the screen and on the screen. The acting isn\\'t killer, but it is strong across the board, with James Garner and Gena Rowlands ultimately delivering on sparkling chemistry and emotional range in their portrayal of good, but old and deteriorating souls, while the dashing Ryan Gosling and gorgeous Rachel McAdams carry most of the film with their distinguished charismas, bonded through powerful chemistry, and backed with a human emotional resonance that is more layered than the actual written characterization of the Noah Calhoun and Allison \"Allie\" Hamilton characters, who are well-defined enough by their portrayers to engross as worthy leads. Many are not likely to walk away loving this film, but it is rather underappreciated, being flawed something fierce, but ultimately with enough inspiration and rich soul to thoroughly engage and ultimately reward.\\n\\nOverall, pacing unevenness keeps the film from soaking up its full depth, whose kick goes further diluted by subtlety issues and conventionalism, until you\\'re left with a flawed final product, but one that still compels, using lovely cinematography and score work to compliment the taste within Nicholas Sparks\\' undeniably meaty story concept, which is brought to life well enough by Nick Cassevetes\\' direction and a strong cast for \"The Notebook\" to ultimately stand as a flawed, but quite good melodrama that rewards the patient.\\n\\n3/5 - Good', 'good movie thought i would get bored but i liked it', 'Ok a friend told me to watch it and it is a fine movie!!!!!!', \"This movie is great........it's beautiful......it's about love.......life.......and death.........definitely a tearjerker.......at least one box of Kleenex was used in the watching of this movie.\", 'all they think about is sex which disgusts me', \"The book is much better...

Now, I'm not saying that this movie is amazing, because it's not, far from it actually. But it is a sweet (tear jerk-er) that does in fact dig deep with it's emotional resonance and pretty good plot line. Except for the two old people. I hated them. They were so annoying and don't give much to the story besides a little more drama that actually isn't needed.

I loved it.', 'very very very good movie', 'wow ppl said it was a powerful movie n i didnt believe them.. noah looks bad witha  beard tho..', 'One of the very best love stories!!', 'I loved this movie it was heartwrenchingly beautiful', 'i generally don\\'t associate romance movies with the word \"good\", but this is definitely the exception!', 'Call me stupid, cause I think that this romance is actually a great movie, it\\'s entertaining and it has an interesting story. It\\'s not just another romance or chick filck, well, it is, but it\\'s a great one. I didn\\'t like it for the same reasons girls did, I was amused by the romance or anything like that, I was just simply entertained watching it, the development of the story, the back-up story with the two main characters now with a certain age, I really liked this movie, everything was well set and even Dale Arbus (Charlie Day) from Horrible Bosses (My Favorite Movie) liked it. Sow, if you\\'re a guy, I do recommend you to watch this movie, nto becaus eof the romance or other things like that, but I think you\\'ll just find it interesting and girls, watch this movie if you haven\\'t, because I can\\'t think of one single girl who didn\\'t like it. Great movie.\\n\\nNick Cassavetes is the guy who directs this movie, he did a nice job, not a terrific one but yes he did left us here a great romance. Ryan Gosling is fine here, this was defenitly not the highlight of his career but he had a good character and an aceptable perfomance, back then, I think he was a bit far from his current talent, but yes, he was good in this movie, really good indeed, Ryan is known from my seventh favorite movie, wich is Crazy, Stupid, Love, he is also known from Drive, Blue Valentine, Half Nelson, The Ides of March and some other movies. Rachel McAdams was like Ryan here, she had an okay character and a nice perfomance, this was also not the highlight of her carrer, but if someone asks me to name the movies with her three best perfomances, The Notebook would might be among those three movies, Rachel is known from The Hot Chick, Sherlock Holmes, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shaddows, The Vow, The Time Traveler\\'s Wife and some other movies. James Garner is fine here, James is known from Battle for Terra, Maverick, The Great Escape, The Rockford Files and some other movies. James Marsden is mediocre, he has done better perfomances but he has done good here with his not long at all screen time. Sow, as you can see, this movie\\'s cast is very good, well, on a 1 to 10 scale, I would give it a 7.2, this movie has a great cast, there\\'s great characters and great perfomances. Great cast.\\n\\nNoha (Ryan Gosling) is a poor young man who lives with his father and Allie (Rachel McAdams) is a rich girl who lives with great luxury, those two teenagers who meet at a carnival. They both quickly fall in love and their love started to be a bit more than just a summer passion. Noah is separated from Allie when the summer ends and she has to go to New York to go to college. After a long time without nothing happening, Allie meets Lon Hammond (James Marsden), and after sometime together, they get engaged, even though Allie hasn\\'t completely forgot Noah. Allie decides to visit Noah after a long time apart and they both quickly fall in love again and now, Allie has to decide between spending the rest of her life with her fiancé ot with her first love.(What I thought about the plot) I liked the plot, it was well written and even though it has some cliches and some \"romance movies (chick flicks) cliches\" and also lots of things in it that we\\'ve already watched before, I think that the plot was well written and it has an interesting development and two kind of predictable endings. Sow, I do think that this plot was well written and it worked well here. Great plot.\\n\\nSoundtrack, well, the soundtrack wasn\\'t memorable but it was okay, when I don\\'t remember it it\\'s because it wasn\\'t that amazing but I do remember to here a good theme while I was watching this movie, but the soundtrack is never really important.\\n\\nBesides all that, I am now going to tell you what I really thought about this movie. First of all, I never knew that I was going to watch such a good movie as this, even though some people told me lots of good things about it and it had a 7.8 on IMDb, I just didn\\'t know that I was going to like it so much, I mean, it\\'s just really entertaining and fun, the development the characters, this movie was really well made. I think if you haven\\'t watched this movie, you should. If we think well, yes, this is just another rom-com, well, but it surprasses lots of rom-coms that I\\'ve seen before, yes it has several cliches, but there\\'s just some glow in this movie that I can\\'t explain, it wasn\\'t nominated for any Oscar, wich I thought it was acceptable, this is no masterpiece, this is just those kinds of movies that get an MTV award for best kiss, bla, bla, bla, but it\\'s really worth watching it. Overall, this is a really good rom-com that even though it\\'s not my type, I guess everyone will like it (Man\\'s Advice), it has a great cast, a great plot and it\\'s entertaining, so entertaining that I got crazy to remember that this movie had an almost 2 hour lenght. Watch this movie if you haven\\'t, it\\'s worth it. Really good.\\n\\nReally good movie. Very recommended movie. Grade: B.', 'Laughed through most of it.  Pissed off my ex-girlfriend.

I liked their characters and I found them easy to root for. The movie at times feels like its trying too hard to make you feel certain emotions, but by the time it ends, I appreciated it for it is.

And rightly so: shortly after watching it, I was curious and got the book at my local Walgreens. Sappy. Godawful writing. Fluff. A la Nora Roberts. Couldn't make it past page 50.

But here is the best thing in the movie HUBBA HUBBA Ryan Gosling is gorgeous I couldn\\'t stop smiling whenever he was on screen. I could go on for hours about that face, but I would sound even more weird than I already do. He is one fine specimen and the best actor in the movie. McAdams is also good and the chemistry was believable enough. BUT GOSLING\\'S FACE is the star of the show!!!! I USUALLY DON\\'T DO THIS BOY CRAZY THING (I put this in caps so people don\\'t click away because I did that little burst of boy crazy) if you check out my other reviews, but I get a free pass with Gosling because he is too good looking not to freak out about and I will freak out about him in every movie review of him. Now for the bad it is so cliched I want to barf, \"If you\\'re a bird, I\\'m a bird.\" SERIOUSLY? NO ONE SAYS THAT! Also the ending really pissed me off because that just doesn\\'t happen. Also I felt like they crammed in too many obstacles for the couple like it was trying to be every single love epic in history, it didn\\'t need that.

Instead of showing us highlights and lowlights of a love story, it goes into great detail to show us pretty much everything that happened to its characters.

I was let down more often than not.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning with the always reliable James Garner, <i>The Notebook</i> has some promise. Our opening scene shows Garner choosing to read a story to a dementia patient played by Gena Rowlands. Most of the film is spent with the characters within this story, instead of the ones reading it, even though I would have loved to spend more time with Garner and Rowlands. Anyway, the story that Garner reads is a long one, spanning many years, and will take up the next two hours of your life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn it, we meet our two leads early on. The first is a country boy named Noah (Ryan Gosling), who sees Allie (Rachel McAdams) at the local fair and decides to make her the center of his attention. He can't take his eyes off her, even though she comes from a wealthy family. The two should be separated by society, but after a daring ploy and a couple of conversations, each falls deeply in love with the other. I suppose almost being run over by a car can do that for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite their love, they don't really have anything else that a relationship should have. They constantly fight, we're told, and despite Noah's father (Sam Shepard) not taking issue with Allie, her parents (Joan Allen and David Thorton) don't like Noah. Or, more correctly, they don't like the type of person he is. They're fine with him, and think he's a nice guy, but since he works with lumber making less than a half dollar per hour, and will never have the type of wealth they have, they have to disapprove.\\r\\n\\r\\nEventually, the pair is separated thanks to Allie's parents, and they move on with their lives. Allie gets engaged to the type of man her parents approve of (James Marsden), and Noah continues working. But the thought of the other person continues to permeate their minds. I'll leave the plot synopsis here because I might have spoiled too much already, but considering this is when the film actually gets going, I figure it's fair game to explain it until here.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, what we've got here is a love story in which the villains are the woman's parents. There's one twist in the plot, and while it's not all that surprising, it's game changing. You see things in a different perspective after it occurs, even though <i>The Notebook</i> didn't have to do too much to hide it from you. It's something that sets up a near-perfect ending as well, which is always nice to see.\\r\\n\\r\\n<i>The Notebook</i> is definitely a tear-jerker. If you don't know that going in, I'd like to direct you to your local tissue store now. I'm not going to give the ending away, but because of how much time we spend with the characters, there are a few emotional moments which resonate with the audience. We understand these people, and we feel sorry or happy for them whenever they are feeling that way themselves. That's something that needs to happen in a film like this, so thankfully director Nick Cassavetes paid close attention to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I do believe that he gave us too much time when not much is going on, leading to a few moments when we get bored. While I'm not saying that this material should be given only 90 minutes, there were definite points when the pacing was just a little too slow thanks to moments which shouldn't have made the final cut. Cut out 10-15 minutes, and we have a better film, although I can imagine if that were to have happened, fans of the novel which the film is based on might not have been too happy. You can't please everyone, I suppose.\\r\\n\\r\\nActually, the length of the film wasn't really the problem, and if those 10-15 minutes were given to Garner and Rowlands, I wouldn't have had a problem. Even if they were left in and given to the Noah/Allie storyline, I would be okay if the events depicted weren't boring. While most of the film is a slow burn, the flame goes out at a few select moments which lead to me losing focus on what I was watching. I don't need to see (what felt like) a dozen shots of Ryan Gosling painting wood, for instance.\\r\\n\\r\\nI liked most of the actors in their roles, even if Rachel McAdams couldn't hold an accent to save her life. Our film is set in the 1940s, and she tries to put on a southern accent. It's there for maybe a quarter of the time she's on-screen, but otherwise disappears, leading me to wonder if it was necessary in the first place, especially considering her co-star didn't seem to attempt anything. They're both likable and play their characters well, but that accent slippage did bug me a bit.\\r\\n\\r\\n<i>The Notebook</i> is overlong, but not unsatisfying. It's a tear-jerker, and it certainly succeeds at that part. It gives us flawed humans as our main characters, and forces us to spend so much time with them that it's difficult not to relate with them. When the ending, and the twist in the plot, comes, it does make us feel something, although you'll be emotional for more of the movie than just that. It is, at times, too slow, but it all leads up to a near-perfect conclusion.\", 'Best Love Movie Ever!', 'One of my faves, another weepy one', \"It's a very beautiful told love story. it's what a love story should be like my favorite part of the movie is when they both hold each other's hands and fall asleep forever together\", \"Maybe better than today's romantic films, The Notebook still lacks the power of a good script and tipical chlichÃ (C)s.

I'd say two and a half stars is pretty fair. If you're in it for some deeper story or some clever plot twist to keep with the entertainment, you won't find it. It's as predictable and as bland as any chick flick could ever be, and there honestly isn't that much here for a guy to enjoy. It lacks any real depth to the plot, it explores areas of story telling we've seen hundreds of times over (guy falls for girl he can never have but eventually does anyway... shocker), and the last true plot twist was predictable from the beginning of the film. Now I'll be honest, the end of the film is a tear jerker and I don't care how manly you think you are, if you aren't pushed to even a little bit of sadness and waterworks during the ending scenes of this film, you have no soul or you have severely damaged some emotional synapse in your brain. Don't see it because it's a good film; it really isn't. See it because your girlfriend wants you too and at the very least, pretend to enjoy it.

Maybe it\\'s the fact that it makes us believe in pure love. A mid west affair, pure and intriguing in many ways, is tested by time in this perfectly placed romantic film. I\\'ve seen many romantic films, they are all the same. Loaded with over done awkward moments and terrible melodrama, most romantic films follow the structure of: boy meets girl, boy tries to get girl, scene after scene of awkward behavior from boy, she falls in love, happy happy, so on so on, etc. Now, I\\'m not saying that the romantic genre is completely delusional and predictable, well, maybe I am! Besides the point, the genre has survived many years of constant change in \"audience expectation\", they must be doing something right. What I believe is different with The Notebook and the reason why us women can\\'t help but swoon over is the fact that, it depicts something that is overly true, it\\'s not impossible. Even though many women ask, \"why can\\'t I have that?\", it\\'s not that you can\\'t, it\\'s just that society has twisted and complicated the meaning and essence of love so much, that people over think it. The Notebook successfully depicts how simple it is to fall head over hills in love when love is treated respectfully and purely. No over done close ups and zooms of Rachel McAdams body in this film, because that\\'s not what it\\'s about. Director Nick Cassavetes created a romantic film that focused on the simple problems that come about in simple and raw love. Over-bearing parents, security in money and so on. He focused on the simple yet normal problems a couple has when you bring two different people together from two different lifestyles. Partnered with his basic filming style, it sets the tone for the film, nothing fancy here. Cassavetes\\' use of basic scene frames and camera movement is perfectly used to help keep the focus on what\\'s important, Noah and Alley.

Well, ''The Notebook'' definitely falls into that classification for me. I have to admit, I don't really love mainstream films (there are exceptions of course), and this one had quite a huge following behind it, albeit mostly teenage girls (I probably should have known what I was getting myself into), but I still gave it a chance, hoping it would be a pleasant love story. But, alas, it was not to be. If I had to sum it up in one word, it would be ''bleh.'' Could a film's plot and characters get any more transparent? Perhaps, but hopefully I won't ever have to find out. Could you (excluding the Twilight series and the other Nicolas Sparks adaptations -- at least from what I've read others say -- if ''The Notebook'' changed my life in any way, it encouraged me to be more thoughtful about the films I watch, i.e, avoiding the rubbish ones) find a greasier chick flick? *So* formulaic, cheesy and dull... if you can't see its ending coming from a mile away, well, I dunno what I can say (I guess ''good for you, at least you somehow managed to enjoy it.'') It's only redeeming features are Ryan Gosling's performance (who I didn't even think was that good when I saw it at the time) and the cinematography.

More than that however, it is a movie about what love truly is, about the concept of never-ending love, and how you despite hard odds and misfortune may love someone forever.  This is also what divides people into two camps in this movie, romantics love it, cynics hate it. \\n\\nPersonally, I am quite torn about it. On the one hand, I find it way too cheesy and cliché-ridden to be a good love story at all. Some of the dialogue made me cringe and the overall story arc is both predictable (the big surprise of the movie can be spotted miles away) and drags on in a clumsy and bland manner. \\n\\nOn the other hand, a part of me enjoys that someone challenges the widespread cynical view of what love is and does it with such conviction. Admittedly, there were scenes that fulfill the purpose and make me feel for the lovers' story. The framing and camera work are generally well done and locations beautiful. However, it is quite obvious that these are part of all the other things that the director is using, trying to make us feel for his story. After not too long, it comes of as rather desperate. \\n\\nAt the end of the day , the movie is just too cheesy. If we use a metaphor and say that Cassavetes wanted to make a sweet-tasting ice cream, he put way too much sugar in there, and draped the cone in sugar, made the topping from sugar and exchanged the cherry for a sugar lump.

I had to really see it because I keep hearing people talking about how good the movie was, and how the kissing-in-the-rain moment was the best thing to ever happen in a romantic movie. Apparently, it was a decent moment, but it's kinda overrated\\n\\nWhat makes this movie so unique is that it tells a story of a couple fell in love over many years. Not only that, but how they got into rough moments from each other. The plot was interesting and well told, but it takes too long to get into the point. Additionally, the story is something that people can relate to. \\n\\nThe performance from each cast were great. They all deserve an Oscar, if this movie would have gotten more positive reviews. The two main cast (Rachel McAdams & Ryan Gosling) put so much talent into their characters and had a good chemistry here. It did had a well-written script, which you hardly see in most Romantic films.\\n\\nThe Notebook is one of the few Romantic films that I really enjoy.
